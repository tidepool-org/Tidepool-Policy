# Asset Inventory Management

`2020.1`

You can't protect what you can't see.  Therefore, it is imperative for Tidepool
to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of both its physical and
digital assets.

More details on data inventory and data lifecycle management is documented
separately in [Data Management](data-mgmt.md).

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) IT and/or Security must maintain an inventory of all critical company
assets, both physical and logical.

(b) All assets should have identified owners and be tagged with a risk/data
classification.

(c) All physical assets must be labeled with a company property tag.



## Controls and Procedures


### Physical Asset Inventory

Tidepool IT leverages a SaaS-based IT asset management system,
JupiterOne, to maintain inventory of all company
owned physical computing equipment, including but not limited to:

* servers
* workstations
* laptops
* printers
* networking equipment

Each record includes details of the physical device such as manufacturer, model
as well as ownership details and property tag ID.

The movement of computing hardware and electronic media is maintained as part of
the records, including media re-use and ownership reassignment.

Tidepool IT manager is responsible for ensuring each physical asset is applied
with a Tidepool property tag, and an up-to-date record is maintained in the IT
asset management system.

All company-owned devices are subject to a complete data wipe if deemed necessary, such as in the 
case of device infection or repurpose. This data wipe will be carried out by the IT manager.


### Digital Asset Inventory

Tidepool Security team uses an automated system to query across our cloud-based
infrastructure, including but is not limited to AWS, to obtain detailed records
of all digital assets, including but not limited to:

* Virtual machines
* AWS EC2 instances
* AWS S3 repositories
* AWS Lambda functions
* Security agents
* Source code repositories
* User accounts

The records are stored in a database system maintained by Tidepool security
team. Records are tagged with owner/project and classification when applicable.
All records are kept up to date via automation.

### Paper Records

Tidepool does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper
for recording and storing sensitive data is against Tidepool policies.
