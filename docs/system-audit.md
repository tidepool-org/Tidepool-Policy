# System Audits, Monitoring and Assessments

`2020.1`

Tidepool shall audit, monitor, and assess the access and activity of
systems and applications that process or store production and/or sensitive data
such as personally identifiable information (PII)
and electronic protected health information (ePHI)
in order to ensure compliance.

It is required by the HIPAA Security Rule, that healthcare organizations to
implement reasonable hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that
record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

Audit activities may be limited by application, system, and/or network auditing
capabilities and resources. Tidepool shall make reasonable and
good-faith efforts to safeguard information privacy and security through a
well-thought-out approach to auditing that is consistent with available
resources.

It is the policy of Tidepool to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of applications, systems, and networks. To ensure that appropriate
safeguards are in place and effective, Tidepool shall audit access and activity
to detect, report, and guard against:

* Network vulnerabilities and intrusions;
* Breaches in confidentiality and security of sensitive information;
* Performance problems and flaws in applications;
* Improper alteration or destruction of sensitive information;
* Out of date software and/or software known to have vulnerabilities.

This policy applies to all Tidepool systems that store, transmit, or process
sensitive information.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) All critical computing systems and software, both virtual and physical, must
enable audit logging.

(b) Audit logs must include sufficient information to identify who did what,
when, where.

(c) An annual audit of Tidepool security controls must be conducted, either by a
designated internal audit team or a qualified external audit firm.



## Controls and Procedures


### Types of System Audits

Tidepool's auditing processes include the following.

1. **Configuration and Activity Monitoring:** This refers to the logging,
   monitoring, scanning and alerting of a system, account, or environment, which
   may be achieved using real-time automated scripts/software or a manual
   review/testing. This type of auditing is performed *continuously* as part of
   Tidepool operations.

    !!! tip "Examples include:"

        * User: User and account-level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.
        * Application: Application-level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.
        * System: System-level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, file integrity, and other system-defined specific actions.
        * Network: Network-level scans or audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, perform penetrations, and identify vulnerabilities.
        * Traffic: Traffic refers to the incoming and outgoing traffic into and out of production/restricted environments. For example, firewall logs or VPC flow logs in AWS.
        * Data: Data includes all successful and failed attempts at production data access and editing.

        *Data associated with above events will include origin, destination, action performed, timestamp, and other relevant details available.*

2. **Access Review:** This refers to the review of all user and service accounts
   and permissions across Tidepool operational environments, including
   on-premise systems, cloud environments such as AWS accounts, and other
   applications such as collaboration software, ticketing system and code repos.

    * Tidepool developed an internal tool to automatically pull configurations
      from our cloud based environments, including
        - AWS access configuration from IAM policies, EC2 VPC and security group
          settings, S3 bucket policies, Lambda and API Gateway resources, etc.;
        - Users, groups, application access from Okta IdP;
        - Network access settings from Cisco Meraki, etc.
    * The data is collected either on demand triggered by security team or by
      changes in the operational environment.
    * The data is used by the tool to aggregate and analyze user and application
      access.
    * Access to other systems and applications that are not covered by this
      automated tool are reviewed manually on a quarterly
      basis or with any significant change to the target environment.
    * As a result of each review, unused or invalid access will be removed.

3. **Compliance and Controls Audit:** This refers to the audit performed against
   the Technical, Administrative, and/or Physical controls as defined in
   Tidepool policies and procedures, to measure their adoption and
   effectiveness.  This type of auditing is typically performed by either a
   designated internal audit team or an external audit firm, at *defined
   intervals* or prompted by a *trigger event*.

    !!! tip "Potential trigger events include:"

        * Scheduled compliance audit/assessment (e.g. annual risk assessment)
        * High risk or problem prone incidents or events, or as part of post-incident activities
        * Business associate, customer, or partner complaints
        * Identification of significant security vulnerabilities
        * Atypical patterns of activity
        * Failed authentication attempts
        * Remote access use and activity
        * Activity post termination
        * Random audits


### Security Events Analysis

Security logs, events, and audit trails are reviewed by the security team with
the assistance of automated systems and processes.

* Auditing logs are automatically analyzed and correlated by the monitoring
  solutions and/or a centralized security information and event management
  system.
* The systems are configured with rules/policies to identify suspicious
  activities, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
* Alerts are triggered upon identification of an issue based on the policy
  configuration.  
* The alerts are sent immediately to the responsible staff (e.g. security team)
  for analysis. The alerts may be sent via email, Slack messaging, or as
  notification on the monitoring dashboard.
* Analysis is prioritized based on alert severity.  High severity alerts are
  typically reviewed within 24 hours.
* Incident response process is followed, as needed.
* Patches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner.


### Internal/Manual Auditing Activities

Additional manual reviews, such as user accounts and access auditing, may be
necessary from time to time. These activities may be triggered by the events
listed above.

* Responsibility for audit activity is assigned to Tidepool's Security Officer.
  The Security Officer shall:

    * Assign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the
      workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network;
    * Assign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member
      responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer,
      or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task;
    * Organize and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit
      compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sizes, report
      formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.).
    * All connections to Tidepool are monitored. Access is limited to certain
      services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created,
      are reviewed on an annual basis.

* The manual review process shall define and include:

    * Description of the activity as well as rationale for performing the audit.
    * Identification of personnel to perform the review (workforce members shall
      not review audit logs that pertain to their own system activity).
    * Frequency of the auditing process.
    * Determination of significant events requiring further review and
      follow-up.
    * Identification of appropriate reporting channels for audit results and
      required follow-up.

* Manual audits and reviews activities are tracked in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org.

* Auditing, reviews and testing may be carried out internally or provided
  through an external third-party vendor. Whenever possible, a third party
  auditing vendor should not be providing the organization IT oversight services
  (e.g., vendors providing IT services should not be auditing their own services
  to ensure separation of duties).

### Audit Requests

1. A request may be made for an audit for a specific cause. The request may come
   from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, Privacy Officer,
   Security Officer, Customer, Partner, or an Application owner or application
   user.

2. A request for an audit for specific cause must include time frame, frequency,
   and nature of the request.

3. A request for an audit must be reviewed and approved by Tidepool's Privacy
   Officer and/or Security Officer before proceeding. Under no circumstances
   shall detailed audit information be shared with parties without proper
   permissions and access to see such data.

    * Should the audit disclose that a workforce member has accessed sensitive data
      inappropriately, the minimum necessary/least privileged information shall
      be shared with Tidepool's Security Officer to determine appropriate
      sanction/corrective disciplinary action.
    * Only de-identified information shall be shared with Customer or Partner
      regarding the results of the investigative audit process. This information
      will be communicated to the appropriate personnel by Tidepool's Privacy
      Officer or designee. Prior to communicating with customers and partners
      regarding an audit, it is recommended that Tidepool consider seeking
      guidance from risk management and/or legal counsel.


### Review and Reporting of Audit Findings

1. Audit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely
   manner, at least monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s).
   Additional reviews are performed as needed to assure the proper data is being
   captured and retained.

2. The reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit
   findings to relevant workforce members, Customers, or Partners.

    * Significant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format.
      Tidepool's security incident response form may be utilized to report a
      single event.
    * Routine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure
      in a written report format.

3. Reports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum
   necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally
   without administrative and/or legal counsel approval.

4. Security audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that
   may be included in Tidepool's performance improvement activities and
   reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are
   disclosed to administrative-level oversight structures only and that
   information which may further expose organizational risk is shared with
   extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in
   organizational reports (individually-identifiable information shall not be
   included in the reports).

5. Whenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective
   actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with
   the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners.


### Audit Trails and Application Security Events Logging Standard

Tidepool logging standards requires application and system logs to contain
sufficient information to determine **who did what, when, where** to ensure
recording of security and audit events and to generate evidence for unauthorized
activities.

All systems and software developed at Tidepool must have the following security
events logging enabled as part of or in addition to standard application
logging.

1. All security log events must have the following attributes at minimum:

    * Timestamp of the event (synchronized to approved time server)
    * Identifier of the principal performing the action (such as user ID)
    * Location including both origin (such as hostname/IP) and target (such as
      host/service/resource)
    * Activity or action (such as log in, log out, create, read, update, delete
      of a resource)
       - the action may be logged as and determined by the HTTP request method
         and the API endpoint 
    * Event description and additional details may be logged depending on the
      system or application 

2. The following types of security events must be logged at minimum:

    * User and group administration activities (user or group added, updated,
      deleted, access granted/revoked)
    * All login attempts, successful and unsuccessful including the source IP
      address
    * All interactive logoffs
    * Privileged actions (configuration changes, application shutdown/restart,
      software update etc)
    * Major application events (e.g. application failure, start and restart,
      shutdown)
    * Any and all actions performed on critical resources such as production
      data

3. All application and system logs must not include (removed or masked):

    * Any sensitive information, including
      protected health information (PHI),
      personally identifiable information (PII)

      - except for IP addresses
      - usernames/logins may/should be logged as part of authentication logging
      - for user action auditing, opaque IDs should be used instead of
        usernames/logins whenever possible

    * Authentication and session tokens, user credentials
  
4. Security events and audit logs must be:

    * Always accessible to the monitoring system/team
    * Protected from any changes
    * Monitored with alerting mechanism in place (including alert for not
      receiving log events for a certain period of time)

5. All Tidepool IT infrastructure must have system clock synchronized

*Examples of recommended application events for logging and their auditing purpose:*

Events                                                | Purpose
---------                                             | ---------
Client requests and server responses                  | forensics and debugging - details level is defined by application
Successful and unsuccessful login attempts            | authentication
Successful and failed access to application resources | authorization, escalation of privileges
Excessive amount of requests from the client          | brute-forcing, malicious bots, denial of service attacks
E-mails sent by an application                        | spamming, social engineering

### Audit Trail Integrity - Security Controls and Log Retention

1. Audit logs shall be protected from unauthorized access or modification, so
   the information they contain will be made available only if needed to
   evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in
   this policy.
2. All audit logs are protected in transit and encrypted at rest to control
   access to the content of the logs.
3. Whenever possible, audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to
   minimize the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent
   access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges.

    * Separate systems are used to apply the security principle of "separation
      of duties" to protect audit trails from hackers.
    * Tidepool logging servers may include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
      (ELK) as part of their baseline configuration to ease reviewing of audit
      log data. The ELK toolkit provides message summarization, reduction, and
      reporting functionality.

4. Reports summarizing audit activities shall be retained for a period of seven
   years.
5. Audit log data is retained locally on the audit log server or in the source
   environment for a period of one month. Beyond that, log data is encrypted and
   moved to warm storage (currently S3) using automated scripts, and is retained
   for a minimum of one year.
6. Raw event data may be purged after one month / 30 days as long as the
   required details are sufficiently covered in aggregated audit logs/reports.


### Auditing Customer and Partner Activity

1. Periodic monitoring of Customer and Partner activity shall be carried out to
   ensure that access and activity is appropriate for privileges granted and
   necessary to the arrangement between Tidepool and the 3rd party.
   Tidepool will make every effort to assure Customers and Partners
   do not gain access to data outside of their own environments.

1. If it is determined that the Customer or Partner has exceeded the scope of
   access privileges, Tidepool's management and security must remedy
   the problem immediately.

1. If it is determined that a Customer or Partner has violated the terms of the
   HIPAA business associate agreement or any terms within the HIPAA regulations,
   Tidepool must take immediate action to remediate the situation. Continued
   violations may result in discontinuation of the business relationship.


### Auditing and Assessment Tools

Tidepool's Security Officer is authorized to select and use assessment tools
that are designed to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions. Use of such tools
against Tidepool systems and environments are prohibited by others, including
Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorization of the Security
Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to:

* Scanning tools and devices;
* Password cracking utilities;
* Network "sniffers";
* Security agents installed locally on servers and endpoints;
* Passive and active intrusion detection systems; and
* Penetration testing tools.

Vulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what
is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether
publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the
system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls.

### Training, Education, Awareness and Responsibilities

1. Tidepool workforce members are provided training, education, and
   awareness on safeguarding the privacy and security of business and data.
   Tidepool's commitment to auditing access and activity of the
   information applications, systems, and networks is communicated through new
   employee orientation, ongoing training opportunities and events, and
   applicable policies. Tidepool workforce members are made aware of
   responsibilities with regard to privacy and security of information as well
   as applicable sanctions/corrective disciplinary actions should the auditing
   process detect a workforce member's failure to comply with organizational
   policies.

2. Tidepool Customers are provided with necessary information to understand
   Tidepool auditing capabilities. Platform Customers are responsible for the
   logging, auditing and retention of any application hosted outside of Tidepool
   environments, even though the applications may integrate with Tidepool
   Platform API.  Customer applications hosted within the Tidepool environments
   will follow the auditing standards and procedures defined in this document.
