# Access

`2020.1`

Access to Tidepool systems and application is limited for all users, including
but not limited to workforce members, volunteers, business associates,
contracted providers, consultants, and any other entity, is allowable only on a
minimum necessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of
unauthorized user or access of the organization's information systems.

These safeguards have been established to address the
HIPAA Security regulations and industry best practices.

## Policy Statements

### Access Control Policy

Tidepool policy requires that

(a) Access to all computing resources, including servers, end-user computing
devices, network equipment, services and applications, must be protected by
strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.

(b) Interactive user access must be associated to an account or login unique to
each user.

(c) All credentials, including user passwords, service accounts, and access
keys, must meet the length, complexity, age, and rotation requirements defined
in Tidepool security standards.

(d) Use strong password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible
to authenticate to all computing resources (including both devices and
applications).

(e) MFA is required to access any critical system or resource, including but not
limited to resources in Tidepool production environments.

(f) Unused accounts, passwords, access keys must be removed within 30 days.

(g) A unique access key or service account must be used for different
application or user access.

(h) Authenticated sessions must time out after a defined period of inactivity.

### Access Authorization and Termination

Tidepool policy requires that

(a) Access authorization shall be implemented using role-based access control
(RBAC) or similar mechanism.

(b) Standard access based on a user's job role may be pre-provisioned during
employee onboarding. All subsequent access requests to computing resources must
be approved by the requestor’s manager, prior to granting and provisioning of
access.

(c) Access to critical resources, such as production environments, must be
approved by the security team in addition to the requestor’s manager.

(d) Access must be reviewed on a regular basis and revoked if no longer needed.

(e) Upon termination of employment, all system access must be revoked and user
accounts terminated within 24 hours or one business day, whichever is shorter.

(f) All system access must be reviewed at least annually and whenever a user's
job role changes.

### Shared Secrets Management

Tidepool policy requires that

(a) Use of shared credentials/secrets must be minimized and approved on an
exception basis.

(b) If required by business operations, secrets/credentials must be shared
securely and stored in encrypted vaults that meet the Tidepool data encryption
standards.

(c) Usage of a shared secret to access a critical system or resource must be
supported by a complimenting solution to uniquely identify the user.

### Privileged Access Management

Tidepool policy requires that

(a) Users must not log in directly to systems as a privileged user.

  * A privileged user is someone who has administrative access to critical
    systems, such as a Active Directory Domain Administrator, root user to a
    Linux/Unix system, and Administrator or Root User to an AWS account.

(b) Privilege access must only be gained through a proxy, or equivalent, that
supports strong authentication (such as MFA) using a unique individual account
with full auditing of user activities.

(c) Direct administrative access to production systems must be kept to an
absolute minimum.


## Controls and Procedures


### Standards for Access Provisioning

#### Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information
   systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to
   carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job
   classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment,
   payment, or healthcare operations.
1. All access requests are treated on a "least-privilege" principle.
1. Tidepool maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.
   As such, Tidepool, including all workforce members, does not readily have
   access to any ePHI.

#### Access Authorization

1. Role based access categories for each Tidepool system and application are
   pre-approved by the Security Officer.
2. Tidepool utilizes hardware-defined and/or software-defined boundaries to
   segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of
   service attacks.

#### Person or Entity Authentication

1. Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that
   identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
1. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password or
   OpenID Connect that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
   This is enforced through the use of **AWS Cognito**.
1. All customer support interactions must be verified before Tidepool support
   personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.

#### Unique User Identification

1. Access to the Tidepool Platform systems and applications is controlled by
   requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and
   developer.
1. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).
1. Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in
   plain text.
1. Default accounts on all production systems and environments, including root,
   are disabled/locked.
1. Shared accounts are not allowed within Tidepool systems or networks.

#### Automatic Logon and Logoff

1. Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password
   entry are not permitted for use with Tidepool workstations or production
   systems.  

    * Automatic log-on may only be permitted for low-risk systems such as
      conference room PCs connecting to a Zoom Room.
    * Such systems are configured on separate network VLANs.

1. Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other
   individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected
   screen saver or logging off the system).
1. Information systems automatically lock users such as enabling
   password-protected screensaver after 2 minutes or less of inactivity.
1. Information systems automatically enter standby or log users off the systems
   after 30 minutes or less of inactivity.
1. The Security Officer must pre-approves any exception to automatic log off
   requirements.

### Password Management

1. User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Tidepool systems and may
   not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.
2. Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information
   system using another user's unique user ID and password.
3. On all production systems and applications in the Tidepool environment,
   password configurations are set to require:

    * a minimum length of 12 characters;
    * a mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or
      special characters;
    * a 60-day password expiration, or 60-day password expiration for
      administrative accounts;         
    * prevention of password reuse using a history of the last 24 passwords;
    * where supported, modifying at least 6 characters when changing passwords;
    * account lockout after 5 invalid attempts.

    !!! check "Exceptions"
    
        Password expiration may be set to a greater interval if an account is always protected by MFA. 
        Currently, Okta SSO password rotation interval is set to 60 days.


4. All system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely.

    * Where possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a
      salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger NIST compliant standard).
    * Passwords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at
      rest pursuant to the requirements in [Data Protection](data-protection.md).
    * Transmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the
      requirements in [Data Protection](data-protection.md).

5. Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a
   pre-determined interval as determined by the system owner and/or Security,
   based on the criticality and sensitivity of the data contained within the
   network, system, application, and/or database.
6. Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee's termination (refer
   to the [Employee Termination Procedures in HR policy](hr.md)).
7. All default system, application, and Vendor/Partner-provided passwords are
   changed before deployment to production.
8. Upon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically
   generated for them.
9. Password change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user
   input errors.
10. All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.
11. If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to
    immediately report the incident to the 
    [Security team](mailto:security@tidepool.org).
12. In cases where a user has forgotten their password, password reset
    procedures provided by the IdP shall be followed. The exact process depends
    on the system or application. If help is needed, users shall contact [IT
    Support](mailto:itsupport@tidepool.org) or
    [Security](mailto:security@tidepool.org)
13. An approved password manager is used for to store or share non-critical
    business application passwords that are not integrated with our primary IdP
    through SSO.

    * The password manager locally encrypts the password vault with the user's
      master password before synchronizing to the cloud.
    * The master password must follow the password requirements listed above.
    * MFA must enabled in the password manager configuration.
    * Enrollment of the password manager is configured as an application in
      Okta.

14. An automated process/tool is implemented to ensure compromised passwords or
    common dictionary words are not used as passwords.  This is currently
    implemented in Okta.

### Single Sign On

* Tidepool selected Okta as its primary Identity Provider (IdP) to control
  user access to systems and business applications.

* Single sign-on (SSO) should be used whenever possible instead of local
  authentication.  This centralized approach improves user experience and
  simplifies access management.

* SSO is configured via industry standard SAML protocol between the IdP (Okta)
  and the target application.

* Tidepool will not configure SSO to target applications unless they score a
  "B" rating or higher on the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/)
  benchmark.

* Security team is responsible for the administration of the IdP / SSO system,
  including user and access provisioning. Security team may delegate
  administrative privilege to a subset of the system, such as a specific
  application.

### Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a standard control used by Tidepool to
provide strong access control to critical systems and applications, and should
be enabled whenever possible.

Tidepool implements Okta for MFA.

!!! important

    **Approved MFA methods include:**

    - Push notification delivered through the Okta mobile app (default and preferred for end-user access)
    - Hardware MFA token (required for the root user of AWS accounts)
    - A unique cryptographic certificate tied to a device
    - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) delivered through a mobile app, such as Google Authenticator
    - One-time passcode delivered through SMS text message (if it is the only supported option)
    - Secure physical facility (if the system or application can only be accessed at that location)


### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

By default, user access is granted based on the user's job function / role.
For example:

- Developer
- Security
- IT
- Administrative
- Marketing / Sales

This is defined as **user groups** in .

Access to sensitive data and production customer data is highly restricted and
further defined in its own section.


### Temporary Access to AWS Accounts and Resources

Access to Tidepool AWS accounts are permissible through temporary credentials /
sessions only.  No persistent users, passwords or access keys are allowed in AWS
IAM configurations for end-user access, either to the AWS console or AWS CLI.
This is achieved with the following processes:

**AWS Console Access**

* An organization master account (`Tidepool-master`) in AWS is configured with
  IAM roles such as Developer and Security.
* SAML SSO and trust relationship is established between the roles in
  `Tidepool-master` and an "AWS application" provisioned in Okta.
* Users are assigned their corresponding roles through application and role
  assignment in Okta.
* Via SSO, Users authenticate through Okta by using their Okta username,
  password, and MFA.
* Upon successful authentication and MFA validation, users are logged into
  `Tidepool-master` using AWS Assume Role capability.
* The roles in `Tidepool-master` by default has highly restricted access. For
  example, the `Developer` role does not have access to any services and
  resources in the master account.
* The user is required to Assume a Role in a sub-account, connected via
  cross-account trust policy defined at account bootstrap or through an approved
  change management process.  For example, a Developer can assume the
  `Administrator` role in `Tidepool-dev`, which is the sandboxed development
  environment in a separate AWS account.
* Assume Role access to a production AWS account is highly restricted.

    * Developers can only assume the `Developer` role in production which only
      has access to read CloudWatch logs, XRay system traces/service maps,
      CloudWatch metrics, resource group inventories, and CloudWatch dashboards.
    * Security can only assume the `Auditor` role in production which has the
      default Auditor IAM policy managed by AWS.  This policy allows read-only
      access to account and resource configurations, but does not allow read
      access to any data such as S3 objects.

**AWS CLI/SDK Access**

* [Okta AWS-CLI Tool](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role)
  is used to obtain temporary credentials (access keys) for developers to
  connect to AWS using the CLI or SDK.
* By running the Okta AWS-CLI Tool, developers are prompted to authenticate to
  Okta using their Okta credentials and MFA token/app.
* Upon successful authentication and MFA validation, a temporary access key and
  session token is inserted into the local configuration file (e.g.
  `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`).
* This temporary credentials expires after one hour and a new temporary
  credential must be obtained for access.
* Through this method, developers are granted the same permission as they would
  by assuming the `Developer` role through AWS console.
* Additional details are documented on the [Development Wiki]().

**IAM Safety**

* Tidepool implements **Dome9** to monitor and protect its AWS environments.
  Dome9 provides an additional layer of defense on top of native IAM policies
  called **IAM Safety**.
* IAM Safety works by defining a set of risky actions, such as adding/remove IAM
  users to an **Explicit Deny** policy.  The policy is attached to an IAM Group,
  and protected Users and/or Roles are assigned to this Group.
* Because explicit deny rules always take precedence in AWS IAM policy, this
  effectively restricts access and prohibits execution of the risky actions as
  defined in the policy, even if the user/role may have administrative
  privilege.
* Original access can be temporarily restored through the Dome9 web console or
  its mobile app.
* Privilege Roles, such as Security role in master account and Administrator
  role in production account, are protected by IAM Safety.
* Additional details can be found on [Dome9's product
  documentation](https://dome9-security.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DG/pages/2981893/IAM+Safety+Overview).

**Troubleshooting / Support Access**

In normal operations, troubleshooting is performed with log analysis in Sumo
Logic, outside of the production environments in AWS. A separate Support role is
created for temporary troubleshooting and support access when log access is
insufficient to determine the cause. Support access should be minimized and is
designed to involve manual approval and provision process.

* The Support role by default is NOT assigned to anyone.
* The Support role is configured with Read level access to the services used by
  Tidepool platform services and applications.  It does NOT have permission to
  make any configuration changes and does NOT have access to production data.
* A PRODCM ticket is used to request temporary support access and must be
  approved by Head of Engineering and Security.
* Upon approval of the support access PRODCM ticket, Security grants the
  requestor temporary access to by assigning the Support role to that particular
  individual user in Okta.
* The Support role is protected by Dome9 with IAM Safety and it must be
  explicitly allowed by the Security team for it to assume the Support role in
  the target production environment.
* By default, temporary Support access is limited to one hour.  This can be
  extended by the Security team.
* The role assignment is removed from Okta immediately after the support session
  and Dome9 IAM Safety is re-enabled.

**Dual Control for Root Access**

Tidepool implements a Dual Control / Split Knowledge process to protect the Root
user access to our AWS accounts. The process works as follow:

* Security Lead has access to the root account credentials.

    * The credentials are stored encrypted in the master account.
    * Security Lead obtains temporary access to the master account following the
      process listed above (MFA is required).
    * Security Lead must assume a role with permission to access the credential
      (e.g. Administrator), which is protected by an additional layer of IAM
      Safety.

* Engineering Lead has access to the Hardware Tokens associated with the root
  users.

    * The tokens are stored in secured facility with restricted badge reader
      access.
    * The token serial is mapped per account and documented in [Tidepool
      Engineering Wiki]().

When root access is required for business or operational needs, a https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org Issue is
created that requires the Security Lead and Engineering Lead to jointly perform
the action.

### Remote Access / VPN

* VPN remote access to non-production and non-privileged environments in AWS are
  permissible and implemented using **Pritunl**.

* VPN remote access to master and production accounts are prohibited.

* VPN remote access to Tidepool office network(s) is configured via
  **Pritunl**, and should be used whenever connecting from public networks.


### Access to PHI/ePHI

1. Access to ePHI is permitted to genomics science staff, or staff that
   otherwise has a business need to access.
1. Access to any on-premise server that contains ePHI is restricted and
   monitored. *Currently Tidepool has no on-premise server that stores or
   processes ePHI.*
1. Access to ePHI in Tidepool's production environments in the cloud is strictly
   prohibited. Access is protected via multiple layers of security controls 
   such as IAM policies, restricted IAM roles, VPC configuration, S3 bucket 
   policy, external monitoring, etc.
1. Users may not download ePHI to any workstations or end-user computing
   devices.


### Platform Customer Access to Systems

Tidepool does not allow direct system access by customers. Access is only
available through the Web UI or API interface, with valid authentication and
authorization detailed in the Product Security, Architecture, and Security
pages of the engineering wiki.

### Access Establishment, Modification and Termination

1. Requests for access to Tidepool Platform systems and applications is made
   formally using the following process:

    1. An access request is created in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org through either the new employee
       onboarding request or a specific access request from Tidepool Internal
       Support site.
    1. The Security team will grant standard access to per job role as part of
       new employee onboarding. A standard set of accounts that are default for
       all employees are created as part of the onboarding process. This
       includes
       
        - User account for local system/laptop
        - Okta user in the Everyone group, and additional group based on role
          such as Development, IT, Security
        - Office365 account for access to Outlook email, SharePoint, etc.
        - Ataata account for security awareness training
        - HR accounts for paperwork, benefits management, payroll, expense
          reporting, etc.
        - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org access for submitting support requests
        - Additional role based access (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidepool-org and travis-ci.org, circle-ci.org access for a
          developer)
        
    1. Standard access may be provisioned at any time by account
       owners/administrators at any time during or after onboarding with
       approval of account owners and/or manager.
    1. If additional access is needed in addition to the above, a separate
       access request (through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org) is required and the requester must include
       a description and justification as part of the access request.
    1. Once the review is completed, the Security team approves or rejects the
       Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and
       documentation.
    1. If the review is approved, IT or Security team provisions access, then
       marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
       
        * New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that
          meets all password requirements, which must be changed on the initial
          login.
        * All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.
        * For on-premise systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the
          appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP/AD group.
        * For cloud accounts, access grants are provisioned in Okta or using the
          access control mechanisms built into those services/applications.
        * Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a
          Tidepool employee at the discretion of the Security Officer.

1. Special access, including access to production environments, is not granted
   until receipt, review, and approval by the Tidepool Security Officer.
1. The request for access is retained for future reference.
1. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business
   purposes.

    * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not
      left unnecessarily.
    * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.

1. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content,
   identification and authentication may not be required.

#### Access Termination

IT Manager or Security team receives access termination requests in one of the
following conditions and processes it accordingly:

* Employee existing/termination, as defined by the process in 
  [HR & Employee Security](hr.md);
* Employee access to a system is no longer required as a result of job role
  change or similar event, in which case a access termination request may be
  submitted by the employee or his/her manager via the Internal Help portal or
  an email request to Security team;
* As the result of a Access Review, as defined in 
  [System Auditing](system-audit.md).
* Non-standard access is revoked by default after 30 days of inactivity, unless
  an exception/extension is requested and approved.

### Access Reviews

* All access to Tidepool systems and services are reviewed and updated following
  the procedures specified in [System Auditing](system-audit.md) to ensure proper
  authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions.
* In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate
  steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce
  risk of unauthorized access.

### Privileged Access

Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts
before elevating the privilege or switching to privileged users and performing
privileged tasks.  Examples include:

* `sudo` in Linux/macOS
* `Run as Administrator` in Windows
* `Assume role` in AWS

### Service Accounts

* All application to application communication using service accounts is
  restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are
  used to limit account access across applications and systems.

* Services that are part of Tidepool platform leverage AWS IAM policy
  configurations and/or OAuth for authorization.

* Generic accounts are not allowed on Tidepool systems.

* Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application
  authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict
  access.

* In AWS, service accounts are implemented in the form of IAM Roles, and their
  access defined by the corresponding IAM policies. The creation of these IAM
  roles and policies is implemented as code, which follows the secure
  development, review and production change approval process.

* An inventory of all Service accounts is maintained by AWS IAM and Terraform and
  reviewed periodically.

### Employee Workstation / Endpoints Access and Usage

All workstations at Tidepool are company owned, using one the following approved
hardware vendors and operating systems:

* Apple, Dell, or Lenovo
* macOS, Linux (Ubuntu or Debian), or Windows 10

1. Workstations may not be used to engage in any activity that is illegal or is
   in violation of organization's policies.
1. Access may not be used for transmitting, retrieving, or storage of any
   communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or materials that are
   obscene or "X-rated". Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No messages with
   derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual's race, age,
   disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual
   preference, or health condition shall be transmitted or maintained. No
   abusive, hostile, profane, or offensive language is to be transmitted through
   organization's system.
1. Information systems/applications also may not be used for any other purpose
   that is illegal, unethical, or against company policies or contrary to
   organization's best interests. Messages containing information related to a
   lawsuit or investigation may not be sent without prior approval.
1. Solicitation of non-company business, or any use of organization's
   information systems/applications for personal gain is prohibited.
1. Users may not misrepresent, obscure, suppress, or replace another user's
   identity in transmitted or stored messages.
1. Workstation hard drives will be encrypted using FileVault (macOS), BitLocker
   (Windows) or equivalent.
1. All workstations must have host firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized
   access unless explicitly granted.
1. All workstations must have endpoint security software installed and actively
   running, if supported by the operating system.

### Office Network and Wireless Access

1. Tidepool production systems are not accessible directly over wireless
   channels.
2. Wireless access is disabled on all production systems.
3. When accessing production systems via remote wireless connections, the same
   system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other
   connections, including wired.
4. Wireless networks managed within Tidepool non-production facilities (offices,
   etc.) are secured with the following configurations:

    * All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;
    * Passwords are not currently on a rotation schedule because the office
      environments are considered insecure.  
    * Passwords are changed immediately should a suspicious activity or
      indicator of compromise is detected.
    * Guest wireless access is on a separate SSID configured with different
      password and traffic VLAN.
    * Wireless access is managed by the IT Manager.
    * Wireless access points connected to the network are automatically
      scanned; rogue access points identified are immediately removed.

### Production Access and Secrets Management

Tidepool leverages a combination of [travis-ci.org, circle-ci.org credentials
store](https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/203802500-Injecting-Secrets-into-travis-ci.org, circle-ci.org-Build-Jobs),
[credstash](https://github.com/fugue/credstash), and [Amazon EC2 Systems Manager
Parameter
Store](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/)
to securely store production secrets.  Secrets are always encrypted; access to
secrets is always controlled and audited.

Details and usage are documented on the Tidepool Engineering Wiki.

### Password Reset and other Helpdesk Requests

Tidepool employees have the ability to obtain self-service support directly from
supported business applications, such as password reset via the SSO/IdP tool.

If needed, users may use our internal service desk or email request to obtain IT
and Security support.

A ticket is opened in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org for each support request and assigned to the
appropriate personnel.  The person assigned must verify the identity of the
requester and ensure the ticket has appropriate approval before implementing or
providing support.  The verification step and confirmation of "User identity
verified" should be included as a comment in the ticket by the support
personnel. Additionally, if a password or security credential has been created
or supplied, confirm user has received it via another channel like
slack/email/phone/zoom and document receipt in the ticket.
