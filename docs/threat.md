# Threat Detection and Prevention

`2020.1`

In order to preserve the integrity of data that Tidepool stores, processes, or
transmits for Customers, Tidepool implements strong intrusion detection tools
and policies to proactively track and retroactively investigate unauthorized
access. This include threat detection and prevention at both the network and
host level, as well as threat intelligence monitoring.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) All critical systems, assets and environments must implement realtime threat
detection or prevention.



## Controls and Procedures


### System Malware Protection

1. All end-user workstations and production systems must have antivirus running.
   The default anti-malware solution used is Carbon Black PSC. The anti-malware solution
   will include protection against malicious mobile code.

    * Next generation endpoint protection agent may be used as an equivalent solution.
    * Hosts are scanned continuously for malicious binaries in critical system
      paths. Additionally, if supported, the agent is set to to scan system
      every 2 hours and at reboot to assure no malware is present.
    * The malware signature database is kept up to date, changes are pushed
      continuously.
    * Logs of virus scans and alerts are maintained according to the
      requirements outlined in [System Auditing](system-audit.md).

2. Detected malware is evaluated and removed following the established [incident
   response process](ir.md).

3. All systems are to only be used for Tidepool business needs.


### Firewall Protection

Firewall protection is implemented at the following layers

* **Network** - including Network ACL and Security Groups in AWS as well as on-
  premise firewalls between the office networks and the Internet.

* **Host** - local firewalls are enabled on the user endpoints as well as
  servers (compute and database instances in AWS are protected by security
  groups)

* **Application** - web application firewall (WAF) and content distribution are
  configured at the application layer to protect against common web application
  attacks such as cross site scripting, injection and denial-of-service attacks.

### Network Intrusion Detection

#### Intrusion Detection for On-Premise Internal Networks

* Tidepool leverages AWS GuardDuty and Cisco Meraki for network security of its on-premise
  environments.
* AWS GuardDuty and Cisco Meraki features stateful firewall inspection and intrusion
  detection/prevention (IDS/IPS) of applicable incoming and outgoing network
  traffic. Attacks and suspicious network activities are blocked automatically.
* Tidepool IT manager is responsible for configuring the firewall and IDS/IPS
  rules and review the configuration as least quarterly.

#### Intrusion Detection in AWS Cloud Environments

Tidepool implemented a real-time threat detection solution by
monitoring AWS Cloudtrail events and/or VPC flow logs.

* Cloudtrail events are monitored by **AWS GuardDuty and Cisco Meraki**
* VPC flow logs are sent to and analyzed by **AWS GuardDuty and Cisco Meraki**.

Additional monitoring is provided by our infrastructure service provider AWS.

### Host Intrusion Detection

Host based intrusion detection is supported via one of the following:

* On Windows and macOS systems: **AWS Inspector and Carbon Black PSC** agents for malware
  detection and behavior-based endpoint threat detection.

* On Linux servers: **AWS Inspector and Carbon Black PSC** agents for activity monitoring,
  vulnerability scanning, and threat detection.  This includes all virtual
  instances running in the cloud environment.

### Web Application Protection

 leverages AWS Services to protect web applications against
common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and
denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS) attacks. The services used include AWS Shield, WAF,
Cloudfront, and/or API Gateway.

### Centralized Security Information and Event Management

Security events and alerts are aggregated to and correlated by one or both of
the following solutions:

* JupiterOne
* Internally developed security automation tooling


### Threat Intelligence Monitoring

**NH-ISAC**

Tidepool is an active member of the [National Health Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (NH-ISAC)](https://nhisac.org/).

Tidepool Security team is subscribed to receive threat alerts from NH-ISAC.

**Intelligence Feeds**

Additional intelligence feeds are received automatically through some of the 3rd
party security solutions that have been implemented on the networks and/or
endpoints. The data gathered through these external intel feeds is automatically
used by the security solutions to analyze events and generate alerts.

**Regulatory Requirements Updates**

The Security and Privacy Officer actively monitors the regulatory compliance
landscape for updates to regulations such as HIPAA, PCI and GDPR.
