# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

`2020.1`

The Tidepool Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover Tidepool
following a disruption resulting from a disaster. This Disaster Recovery Policy
is maintained by the Tidepool Security Officer and Privacy Officer.

**HIPAA:** This Tidepool Contingency Plan has been developed as
required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security
Rule, Section ยง164.308(a)(7), which requires the establishment and
implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems
containing electronic protected health information.


## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) A plan and process for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR),
including the backup and recovery of systems and data, must be defined and
documented.

(b) BCDR shall be simulated and tested at least once a year. Metrics shall be
measured and identified recovery enhancements shall be filed to improve the BCDR
process.

(c) Security controls and requirements must be maintained during all BCDR
activities.


## Controls and Procedures


### BCDR Objectives and Roles

#### Objectives

The following objectives have been established for this plan:

1. Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established
   plan that consists of the following phases:

    * *Notification/Activation phase* to detect and assess damage and to
      activate the plan;
    * *Recovery phase* to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage
      done to the original system;
    * *Reconstitution phase* to restore IT system processing capabilities to
      normal operations.

2. Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out
   Tidepool processing requirements during prolonged interruptions
   to normal operations.

3. Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Tidepool
   systems.

4. Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for
   recovering Tidepool during prolonged periods of interruption to
   normal operations.

5. Ensure coordination with other Tidepool staff who will
   participate in the contingency planning strategies.

6. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will
   participate in the contingency planning strategies.

Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural
disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats,
and internal malicious activities.

Tidepool defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.

1. *Critical Systems*. These systems host production application
   servers/services and database servers/services or are required for
   functioning of systems that host production applications and data. These
   systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored,
   or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming
   unavailable.
2. *Non-critical Systems*. These are all systems not considered critical by
   definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and
   overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from
   functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a
   lower priority than critical systems.

#### Line of Succession

The following order of succession to ensure that decision-making authority for
the Tidepool Contingency Plan is uninterrupted. The Chief Operating
Officer (COO) is responsible for ensuring the safety of personnel and the
execution of procedures documented within this Tidepool Contingency
Plan. The Head of Engineering is responsible for the recovery of
Tidepool technical environments. If the COO or Head of Engineering
is unable to function as the overall authority or chooses to delegate this
responsibility to a successor, the CEO shall function as that authority or
choose an alternative delegate. To provide contact initiation should the
contingency plan need to be initiated, please use the contact list below.

* Brandon Arbiter, COO: brandon@tidepool.org
* Tapani Otala, Head of Engineering: tapani@tidepool.org

   related incidents according to Tidepool Incident Response policy
   and procedures. The security team shall assist the above teams in recovery as
   needed in non-cybersecurity events. The team leader is the Security Officer.

Members of above teams must maintain local copies of the contact information of
the BCDR succession team. Additionally, the team leads must maintain a local
copy of this policy in the event Internet access is not available during a
disaster scenario.

All executive leadership shall be informed of any and all contingency events.
Current members of Tidepool leadership team include the
Security Officer, Privacy Officer, VP of Engineering, Security Lead.


### General Disaster Recovery Procedures

#### Notification and Activation Phase

This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage
inflicted by a disruption to Tidepool. Based on the assessment of
the Event, sometimes according to the Tidepool Incident Response
Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the COO or Head of
Engineering.  The Contingency Plan may also be activated by the Security Officer
in the event of a cyber disaster.

The notification sequence is listed below:

* The first responder is to notify the COO. All known information must be
  relayed to the COO.
* The COO is to contact the Response Teams and inform them of the event. The COO
  or delegate is responsible to begin assessment procedures.
* The COO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment
  procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated
  recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of
  unsafe conditions, the COO is to following the steps below.

    * Damage Assessment Procedures:
    * The COO is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the
      infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.
    * Alternate Assessment Procedures:
    * Upon notification, the COO is to follow the procedures for damage
      assessment with the Response Teams.

* The Tidepool Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the
  following criteria are met:

    * Tidepool will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.
    * On-premise hosting facility or cloud infrastructure service is damaged and
      will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.
    * Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Tidepool.

* If the plan is to be activated, the COO is to notify and inform team members
  of the details of the event and if relocation is required.
* Upon notification from the COO, group leaders and managers are to notify their
  respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable
  information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.
* The COO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event
  has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage
  assessment) to the alternate site.
* The COO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the
  general status of the incident.
* Notification can be message, email, or phone.

#### Recovery Phase

This section provides procedures for recovering Tidepool infrastructure and
operations at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair
damage to the original system and capabilities.

Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in
the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.

Recovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Tidepool infrastructure to a production
state.

The tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.

1. Contact Partners and Customers affected to begin initial communication -
   DevOps
2. Assess damage to the environment - DevOps
3. Create a new production environment using new environment bootstrap
   automation - DevOps
4. Ensure secure access to the new environment - Security
5. Begin code deployment and data replication using pre-established automation -
   DevOps
6. Test new environment and applications using pre-written tests - DevOps
7. Test logging, security, and alerting functionality - DevOps and Security
8. Assure systems and applications are appropriately patched and up to date -
   DevOps
9. Update DNS and other necessary records to point to new environment - DevOps
10. Update Partners and Customers affected through established channels - DevOps

#### Reconstitution Phase

This section discusses activities necessary for restoring full
Tidepool operations at the original or new site. The goal is to
restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. If necessary,
when the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored,
Tidepool operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back.
The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate
site to the computer center.

1. Original or New Site Restoration

    * Repeat steps 5-9 in the Recovery Phase at the original or new site /
      environment.
    * Restoration of Original site is unnecessary for cloud environments, except
      when required for forensic purpose.

2. Plan Deactivation

    * If the Tidepool environment is moved back to the original site
      from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should
      be handled and disposed of according to the Tidepool Media
      Disposal Policy.

### Testing and Maintenance

The COO and/or Head of Engineering shall establish criteria for
validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure
implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for
personnel involved in the plan's execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan
shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing
exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all
application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing
process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the
technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will
satisfy the annual requirement.

#### Tabletop Testing

Tabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the
[CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH_VII_4-5_Contingency_Plan_Exercise.pdf).
The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are
knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements
and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include,
but are not limited to:

* Testing to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated,
  timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific
  crisis.

#### Simulation and/or Technical Testing

The primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication
processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate
site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the
designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:

* Process from backup system at the alternate site;
* Restore system using backups; and
* Switch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.


### Work Site Recovery

In the event a Tidepool facility is not functioning due to a
disaster, employees will work from home or locate to a secondary site with
Internet access, until the physical recovery of the facility impacted is
complete. The recovery shall be performed by the facility management firm under
contract with Tidepool, and coordinated by the Facility Manager
and/or the Site Lead.

Tidepoolโs software development organization has the ability to work
from any location with Internet access and does not require an office provided
Internet connection.

### Application Service Event Recovery

Tidepool will develop a status page to provide real time update and
inform our customers of the status of each service. The status page is updated
with details about an event that may cause service interruption / downtime.

A follow up root-cause analysis details (RCA) will be available to customers
upon request after the event has transpired for further details to cause and
remediation plan for the future. Event Service Level

#### Short (hours)

* Experience a short delay in service.
* Tidepool will monitor the event and determine course of action.
  Escalation may be required.

#### Moderate (days)

* Experience a modest delay in service where processes in flight may need to be
  restarted.
* Tidepool will monitor the event and determine course of action.
  Escalation may be required.
* Tidepool will notify customers of delay in service and provide
  updates on Tidepoolโs status page.

#### Long (a week or more)

* Experience a delay in service and processes in flight may need to be
  restarted.
* Tidepool will monitor the event and determine course of action.
  Escalation may be required.
* Tidepool will notify customers of delay in service and provide
  updates on Tidepoolโs status page.


### Production Environments and Data Recovery

Production data is to be synchronized across multiple S3 buckets in AWS.
Additionally, it is backed up to AWS Glacier for long term storage and recovery.
In an event that requires data to be recovered, it will be retrieved from
Glacier.

Tidepool assumes that in the worst-case scenario, that one of the
production environments suffers a complete data loss, the account will be
reconstructed from code, and the data restored from Glacier that is hosted
within a different AWS account and geolocation.

Recovery of production Environments and data should follow the procedures listed
above and in [Data Management - Backup and Recovery](data-mgmt.md#cp-data-backup)
