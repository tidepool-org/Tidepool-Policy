# Roles, Responsibilities and Training

`2020.1`

Security and compliance is everyone's responsibility.  Tidepool is committed to
ensuring all workforce members actively address security and compliance in their
roles. Statistically, cybersecurity breaches typically start with compromise of
end-user computing devices, social engineering, human error or insider threat.
Therefore, users are the first line of defense and yet usually the weakest link.
As such, training is imperative to assuring an understanding of current best
practices, the different types and sensitivities of data, and the sanctions
associated with non-compliance.

In this and all related policy documents, the term "employees" and "workforce
members" may be used interchangeably to include all full-time and part-time
employees in all job roles, contractors and subcontractors, volunteers, interns,
managers and executives at Tidepool.

The Security Officer, in collaboration with the Privacy Officer, is responsible
for facilitating the development, testing, implementation, training, and
oversight of all activities pertaining to Tidepool's efforts to be compliant
with the applicable security and compliance regulations and industry best practices.
The intent of the Security Officer Responsibilities is to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of critical and sensitive data. The Security
and Privacy Officer is appointed by and reports to the Board of Directors and/or
the CEO.

Tidepool has appointed Howard Look as the Security
Officer and Howard Look as the Privacy Officer.


An official **Security Committee** has been formed, chaired by the Security
Officer, and represented by the select members of the senior leadership team
(Security Officer, Privacy Officer, VP of Engineering, Security Lead).

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) A Security and Privacy Officer [164.308(a)(2)]
must be appointed to assist in maintaining and enforcing safeguards towards
security, compliance, and privacy.


(b) Security and compliance is the responsibility of all workforce members
(including employees, contractors, interns, and managers/executives). All
workforce members are required to:

  * Complete all required security trainings, including annual regulatory
    compliance training, security awareness, and any additional role-based
    security training as part of the ongoing security awareness program and as
    required by job role.

  * Complete annual HIPAA awareness training

  * Follow all security requirements set forth in Tidepool security
    policy and procedures, including but is not limited to access control
    policies and procedures and acceptable use policy for end-user computing.

  * See something, say something: follow the incident reporting procedure to
    report all suspicious activities to the security team.

(c) All workforce members are required to report non-compliance of Tidepool's
policies and procedures to the Security Officer or designee. Individuals that
report violations in good faith may not be subjected to intimidation, threats,
coercion, discrimination against, or any other retaliatory action as a
consequence.

(d) All workforce members are required to cooperate with federal, state and
local law enforcement activities and legal investigations. It is strictly
prohibited to interfere with investigations through willful misrepresentation,
omission of facts, or by the use of threats against any person.

(e) Workforce members found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to
sanctions.

(f) Segregation of Duties shall be maintained when applicable to ensure proper
checks and balances and minimize conflict of interests. This helps reduces the
possibility of fraud and insider threat considerably, and eliminates single
points of compromise to critical systems.
