# Breach Investigation and Notification

`2020.1`

To provide guidance for breach notification when impressive or unauthorized
access, acquisition, use and/or disclosure of the ePHI occurs. Breach
notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for
vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule
applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health
records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required
by February 22, 2010.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on
February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security
Rules. While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health
information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business
associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation
process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI
to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23,
2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).

In the case of a breach, Tidepool shall notify all affected
Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected
individuals.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) Breach notification procedures are invoked upon confirmation of security
breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of unprotected/unencrypted
sensitive data.

(b) Individuals impacted by a confirmed data breach must be notified within 60
days of discovery of such breach.

(c) In the event of a data breach that involves unencrypted ePHI,
Tidepool must report the breach to individuals impacted following
the HIPAA Breach Notification requirements (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart D).



## Controls and Procedures


### Breach Investigation Process

1. Discovery of Breach: A data breach shall be treated as "discovered" as of
   the first day on which such breach is known to the organization, or, by
   exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to Tidepool
   (includes breaches by the organization's Customers, Partners, or
   subcontractors). Tidepool shall be deemed to have knowledge of a
   breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would
   have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach,
   who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the
   discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an
   investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response
   and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk
   assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the
   process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Tidepool
   shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are
   required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health & Human
   Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)

1. Breach Investigation: The Tidepool Security Officer shall name an
   individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer,
   security officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible
   for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk
   assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate
   (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk
   management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be
   the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate
   entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All
   documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk
   assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of seven years. A breach log is
   kept and maintained by the Security and Privacy Officer.

1. Risk Assessment: A risk assessment is performed in accordance to applicable
   laws and regulations.

   For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to
   constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy
   Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise
   permissible use or disclosure and occurs despite reasonable safeguards and
   proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy
   Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an
   impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires
   further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment
   to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a
   result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall
   document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident
   report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The
   organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications
   to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a
   breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will
   determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk
   assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and
   address:

    * Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was
      impermissibly disclosed;
    * The type and amount of ePHI involved;
    * The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either
      Customer, Tidepool, or Partner.
    * The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other
      harm.

1. Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made
   to the affected Tidepool Customers, usually within 24-48 hours
   but no later than 10 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. It is
   the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications
   were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of
   delay.

1. Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law
   enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice,
   or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national
   security, the organization shall:

    * If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is
      required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the timer period
      specified by the official; or
    * If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the
      identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification,
      notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of
      the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is
      submitted during that time.

1. Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must
   contain the following information:

    * A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and
      the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security
      number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability
      code or other types of information were involved), if known;
    * Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential
      harm resulting from the breach.
    * A brief description of what Tidepool is doing to investigate
      the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect
      against further breaches.
    * Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional
      information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail
      address, a web site, or postal address.

1. Methods of Notification: Tidepool Customers will be notified via
   email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined
   above.

1. Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to
   the reports created for each incident, Tidepool shall maintain a
   process to record or log all breaches of unsecured sensitive data regardless
   of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information
   should be collected/logged for each breach (see sample Breach Notification
   Log):

    * A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date
      of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers
      affected, if known.
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number,
      date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.
    * A description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients
      regarding the breach.
    * Resolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future
      occurrences.

1. Workforce Training: Tidepool shall train all members of its
   workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to sensitive data as
   necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job
   responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to
   identify and report breaches within the organization.

1. Complaints: Tidepool must provide a process for individuals to
   make complaints concerning the organization's patient privacy policies and
   procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.

1. Sanctions: The organization shall have in place and apply appropriate
   sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail
   to comply with privacy policies and procedures.

1. Retaliation/Waiver: Tidepool may not intimidate, threaten, coerce,
   discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual
   for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right. The organization may
   not require individuals to waive their privacy rights under as a condition of
   the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or
   eligibility for benefits.
