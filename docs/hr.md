# HR and Personnel Security

`2020.1`

Tidepool is committed to ensuring all workforce members actively address
security and compliance in their roles at Tidepool. We encourage self management
and reward the right behaviors. This policy specifies acceptable use of end-user
computing devices and technology. Additionally, training is imperative to
assuring an understanding of current best practices, the different types and
sensitivities of data, and the sanctions associated with non-compliance.

## Policy Statements

In addition to the roles and responsibilities stated [earlier](rar.md),
Tidepool policy requires all workforce members to comply with the
Acceptable Use Policy for End-use Computing and HR Security Policy.

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) Background verification checks on all candidates for employees and
contractors should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations,
and ethics, and proportional to the business requirements, the classification of
the information to be accessed, and the perceived risk.

(b) Employees, contractors and third party users must agree and sign the terms
and conditions of their employment contract, and comply with acceptable use.

(c) Employees will go through an onboarding process that familiarizes them with
the environments, systems, security requirements, and procedures Tidepool has in
place. Employees will also have ongoing security awareness training that is
audited.

(d) Employee offboarding will include reiterating any duties and
responsibilities still valid after terminations, verifying that access to any
Tidepool systems has been removed, as well as ensuring that all company owned
assets are returned.

(e) Tidepool and its employees will take reasonable measures to
ensure no sensitive data is transmitted via digital communications such as email
or posted on social media outlets.

(f) Tidepool will maintain a list of prohibited activities that will be part of
onboarding procedures and have training available if/when the list of those
activities changes.

(g) A fair disciplinary process will be utilized for employees are suspected of
committing breaches of security. Multiple factors will be considered when
deciding the response such as whether or not this was a first offense, training,
business contracts, etc. Tidepool reserves the right to terminate employees in
the case of serious cases of misconduct.



## Controls and Procedures


### Acceptable Use of End-user Computing

Tidepool requires all workforce members to comply with the following
acceptable use requirements and procedures, such that:

(a) Per Tidepool [security architecture](model.md), all workforce

system access controls and procedures for remote access.

(b) Use of Tidepool computing systems is subject to monitoring by
Tidepool IT and/or Security team.

### Employee Onboarding Procedures

A master checklist for employee onboarding is maintained by HR/Facilities.  
It is published in the HR system or the HR folder on
[Tidepool's internal file sharing site](#).

The HR Representative / Facility Manager is responsible to create an Issue in
the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org HR & Facilities project to initiate and track the
onboarding process. The onboarding process should include the following
IT/Security items:

1. Training.

    * New workforce member is provided training on Tidepool security policy,
      acceptable use policy, and given access to the Employee
      Handbook.
    * HIPAA awareness training is provided to new workforce member.
    * Records of training and policy acceptance is kept in the HR system
      (currently EaseCentral).
    * The training and acceptance must be completed within 30 days of
      employment.

2. Access.

    * Standard access is provisioned according to the job role and approval as
      specified in the HR onboarding https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org ticket.
    * Non-standard access requires additional approval following the access
      request procedures.
    * Request for modifications of access for any Tidepool employee
      can be made using the procedures outlined in the
      [Access Establishment and Modification policy and procedures](access.md).

3. System configuration.

    * The end-user computing device (e.g. workstation or laptop) may be
      provisioned by IT to install necessary software, malware protection,
      security agents, and setting system configurations.
    * Users in a technical role, such as Development, may choose to self
      configure their system. In this case, the user is given configuration
      guidelines defined by IT and Security. The system must have the required
      security configuration and endpoint agents installed for monitoring and to
      ensure compliance.

### Employee Exiting/Termination Procedures

A master checklist for employee existing/termination is maintained by
HR/Facilities.  It is published in the HR system or the HR folder on
[Tidepool's internal file sharing site](#).

   their supervisors (HR) are required to notify Security upon completion and/or
   termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the "Termination
   Checklist".

    * A user's password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to
      the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the
      original password);

      password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not
      identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID

### Employee Issue Escalation

Tidepool workforce members are to escalate issues using the
procedures outlined in the Employee Quick Reference. Issues that are brought to
the Escalation Team are assigned an owner. The membership of the Escalation Team
is maintained by the Chief Executive Officer or his delegate.

Security incidents, particularly those involving sensitive data, are handled
using the process described in [Incident Response](ir.md). If the incident
involves a breach of sensitive data, the Security Officer will manage the
incident using the process described in [Breach Notification](breach.md). Refer
to [Incident Response](ir.md) for a list of sample items that can trigger
Tidepool's incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether
the issue is a security incident, contact the Security team immediately.

It is the duty of the incident owner to follow the process outlined below:

1. Create an Issue in the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org Security Project.
2. The Issue is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation
   is reached, it is moved to Review.
3. The Issue is reviewed by another member of the Escalation Team. If the Issue
   is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.
4. If the Issue is approved, it is marked as Done, adding any pertinent notes
   required.
5. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome
   via email.

      integrity, or inability to access data by other users, requires immediate
      termination of the workforce member from Tidepool.

   recurrence of the violation (when possible and feasible).
