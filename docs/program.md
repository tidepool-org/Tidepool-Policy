## Understanding the Policies and Documents

Policies are written in individual documents, each pertaining to a specific
domain of concern.

Each document starts with the current version number and/or last updated date,
followed by a brief summary.  The remaining of the document is structured to
contain two main sections:

* Policy Statements
* Controls and Procedures

All policy documents are maintained, reviewed, updated and approved following
standards and procedures outlined in [Policy Management](policy-mgmt.md).



## Review and Reporting

The information security program, policies, procedures and controls are reviewed
on a regular basis internally by cross functional team members and externally by
qualified assessors.
