# Data Management Policy

`2020.1`

This policy outlines the requirements and controls/procedures Tidepool has
implemented to manage the end-to-end data lifecycle, from data
creation/acquisition to retention and deletion.

Additionally, this policy outlines requirements and procedures to create and
maintain retrievable exact copies of
electronic protected health information(ePHI),
PII and other critical customer/business data.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Tidepool. To
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive and critical data, both for
Tidepool and Tidepool Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that
data remains available when it needed and in case of a disaster.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that

(a) Data should be classified at time of creation or acquisition according to
the [Tidepool data classification model](data-mgmt.md#data-classification-model),
by labeling or tagging the data.

(b) Maintain an up-to-date inventory and data flows mapping of all critical
data.

(c) All business data should be stored or replicated to a company controlled
repository, including data on end-user computing systems.

(d) Data must be backed up according to its level defined in Tidepool data
classification.

(e) Data backup must be validated for integrity.

(f) Data retention period must be defined and comply with any and all applicable
regulatory and contractual requirements.  More specifically,

  * Data and records belonging to Tidepool platform customer must be retained
    per Tidepool product terms and conditions and/or specific contractual
    agreements.

(g) By default, all security documentation and audit trails are kept for a
minimum of seven years, unless otherwise specified by Tidepool data
classification, specific regulations or contractual agreement.



## Controls and Procedures


### Data Classification Model

Tidepool defines the following four classifications of data:

* **Critical**
* **Confidential**
* **Internal**
* **Public**

#### Definitions and Examples

**Critical** data includes data that must be protected due to regulatory requirements, privacy,
and/or security sensitivities.

Unauthorized disclosure of critical data may result in major disruption to
business operations, significant cost, irreparable reputation damage, and/or
legal prosecution to the company.

External disclosure of critical data is strictly prohibited without an approved
process and agreement in place.

*Example Critical Data Types* includes

* PII
* PHI or ePHI
* Production Security data, such as
    - Production secrets, passwords, access keys, certificates, etc.
    - Production security audit logs, events, and incident data

**Confidential** and proprietary data represents company secrets and is of
significant value to the company.

Unauthorized disclosure may result in disruption to business operations and loss
in value.

Disclosure requires the signing of NDA and management approval.

*Example Confidential Data Types* includes

* Business plans
* Employee/HR data
* News and public announcements (pre-announcement)
* Patents (pre-filing)
* Specialized source codes
* Non-production Security data, including
    - Non-prod secrets, passwords, access keys, certificates, etc.
    - Non-prod security audit logs, events, reports, and incident data
    - Audit/compliance reports, security architecture docs, etc.

**Internal** data contains information used for internal operations.

Unauthorized disclosure may cause undesirable outcome to business operations.

Disclosure requires management approval.  NDA is usually required but may be
waived on a case-by-case basis.

*Example Internal Data Types* includes

* Internal documentation
* Policies and procedures
* Product roadmaps
* Most source codes

**Public** data is Information intended for public consumption. Although
non-confidential, the integrity and availability of public data should be
protected.

*Example Internal Data Types* includes

* News and public announcements (post-announcement)
* Marketing materials
* Product documentation
* Contents posted on company website(s) and social media channel(s)


### Data Handling Requirements Matrix

Requirements for data handling, such as the need for encryption and the duration
of retention, are defined according to the Tidepool Data
Classifications.

| Data             | Labeling or Tagging | Segregated Storage | Endpoint Storage | Encrypt At Rest | Encrypt In Transit | Encrypt In Use | Controlled Access | Monitoring | Destruction at Disposal | Retention Period | Backup Recovery |

| **Confidential** | Required            | N/R                | Allowed          | Required        | Required           | Required       | All access is based on need-to-know | Required   | Required   | 7 years for official documentation; Others vary based on business need | Required   |
| **Internal**     | Required            | N/R                | Allowed          | N/R             | N/R                | N/R            | All employees and contractors (read); Data owners and authorized individuals (write) | N/R | N/R | 7 years for official documentation; Others vary based on business need | Optional   |
| **Public**       | N/R                 | N/R                | Allowed          | N/R             | N/R                | N/R            | Everyone (read); Data owners and authorized individuals (write) | N/R     | N/R     | Varies based on business need | Optional   |

N/R = Not Required

† customer-owned data is stored for as long as they remain as a
Tidepool customer, or as required by regulations, whichever is
longer. Customer may request their data to be deleted at any time; unless
retention is required by law.

### Data Inventory and Lifecycle Management

Tidepool Security team uses an automated system to query across our cloud-based
infrastructure, including but is not limited to AWS, to obtain detailed records
of all data repositories, including but not limited to:

* AWS S3 repositories
* AWS RDS and DynamoDB instances
* AWS EC2 volumes
* Source code repositories
* Office 365
* On-premise storage systems (manually maintained)

The records are stored in a database system maintained by Tidepool security
team. Records are tagged with owner/project and classification when applicable.
All records are kept up to date via automation.  The system is also designed to
track movement of data and update/alert accordingly.

**AWS S3 Object Lifecycle Management**

The Tidepool platform will automatically adjust the storage class for certain
types of data based on its usage pattern and age. This allows the Tidepool
platform to provide competitive pricing while still allowing the customer to
store large amounts of data.

AWS provides the following [storage
classes](<https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/>):

* General Purpose
* Infrequent Access
* Archive (Amazon Glacier)

S3 lifecycle policies are used to manage the storage class for certain types of
data. In most cases, the Tidepool platform automatically adjusts the storage
class but we may give customers the ability to adjust the storage class manually
to meet their pricing or performance needs.

Tidepool performs regular full backups of all production data. We leverage S3
lifecycle policies to automatically remove old backup data. This allows older
data to "age out" instead of having to explicitly delete it. S3 lifecycle
policies are also used to adjust the storage class of data backups based on the
age of the backup.

**Other Business Data**

All internal and confidential business records and documents, such as product
plans, business strategies, presentations and reports, are stored outside of an
employee workstation or laptop.

*   Official records are stored in record management systems such as
    - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.tidepool.org (tickets),
    - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidepool-org (source code),
    -  (HR),
    -  (expense reports), etc.

*   Unstructured business documents such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets
    and PowerPoint presentations are stored on Tidepool internal
    file share.

*   Confidential business documents/records are be stored in encrypted form and
    with access control enabled on a need-to-know basis.

**Transient Data Managemet**

Data may be temporarily stored by a system for processing. For example, a
storage device may be used to stage temp/raw files prior to being uploaded
to the production environment in AWS. These transient data repositories are not
intended for long term storage, and data is purged immediately after use.

*Tidepool currently does NOT use transient storage for any sensitive data.*


### Backup and Recovery

#### Customer Data

Tidepool stores data in a secure production account in AWS, using a
combination of S3, DynamoDB, and Aurora SQL databases. By default, Amazon S3
provides durable infrastructure to store important data and is designed for
durability of 99.999999999% of objects.

All data store services and platforms in use are HIPAA compliant.

Tidepool performs automatic backup of all customer and system data to protect
against catastrophic loss due to unforeseen events that impact the entire
system. An automated process will back up all data to a separate AWS region in
the same country (e.g. US East to US West). By default, data will be backed up
daily. The backups are encrypted in the same way as live production data.

Customers can also utilize the Tidepool Application Programming Interface (API)
to extract and store their data elsewhere. Standard API usage fees will apply.

#### Source code

Tidepool stores its source in git repositories hosted by https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidepool-org.

Source code repositories are backed up to Tidepool’s AWS S3 infrastructure
account on a weekly basis with a common set of configuration for each repository
to enforce SDLC processes.

In the event that https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidepool-org suffers a catastrophic loss of data, source code
will be restored from the backups in AWS S3.

Because AWS and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidepool-org can both host git repositories, we are able to
leverage git's ability to maintain a full history of all changes to our git
repos via the commit log.

#### Business records and documents

Each data owner/creator is responsible for maintaining a backup copy of their
business files local on their laptop/workstation to the appropriate location on
Tidepool SharePoint team site. Examples of business files include, but are not
limited to:

* Documents (e.g. product specs, business plans)
* Presentations
* Reports and spreadsheets
* Design files/images/diagrams
* Meeting notes/recordings
* Important records (e.g. approval notes)

Unless the local workstation/device has access to **Critical** data, backups of
user workstations/devices are self managed by the device owner. Backups may be
stored on an external hard drive or using a cloud service such as iCloud if and
only if the data is both encrypted and password protected (passwords must meet
Tidepool requirements).


### Data Deletion Procedures

#### For Platform Customers

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Tidepool understands and
appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a
subcontractor/service provider, and at times a business associate, Tidepool is
not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth
by each state.

Tidepool has created and implemented the following procedures to
make it easier for Tidepool Customers to support data retention
laws.

Some types of customer data may be automatically transitioned to a storage class
that is appropriate for archival or infrequent usage. The guidelines for
transitioning data to different storage classes is at the discretion of
Tidepool.

Customer data is retained for as long as the account is in active status. Data
enters an expired state when the account is voluntarily closed. Expired account
data will be retained for 14 days. After 14 days, the project/account and
related data will be removed. Customers that wish to voluntarily close their
account should download their data manually or via the API prior to closing
their account.

If an account is involuntarily suspended, then there is a 14 day grace period
during which the account will be inaccessible but can be re-opened if the customer
meets their payment obligations and resolves any terms of service violations. If
a customer wishes to manually backup their data in a suspended account, then
they must ensure that their account is brought back to good standing so that the
API and user interface will be available for their use. After 14 days, the
suspended account will be closed and the data will be permanently removed
(except when required by law to retain).

#### For patient data as as a Covered Entity

Tidepool is NOT a covered entity.  Should we become a covered entity in the
future, we would be required by law to retain healthcare records for up to 10
years beyond when service was last provided when providing healthcare services
directly to patients. Any patient data that is marked for deletion will be
archived for the time required by law. This archived data can be retrieved by
the customer as long as it is retrieved within 10 years from date of last
service.
