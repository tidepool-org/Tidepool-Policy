### Support and Management of BYOD Devices

Tidepool provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.


Mobile devices (including personal smart devices) may be used for business
purpoose under the following conditions and management:

- All employee mobile devices accessing or containing company data are
  inventoried and managed by IT using **Jamf**. The inventory will
  maintain current information on the owner of the device, its approved usages,
  installed applications, system status (operating system version and patches),
  and its state (e.g. in-use, lost, decommissioned).

- Mobile device management software is deployed to ensure the proper protection
  and configuration of mobile devices, including:

  - Encryption must be enabled for device storage
  - Device password must be enabled and meet security policy requirements
  - Device must be locked after 2 minutes of inactivity
  - Operating systems and patches are up to date

- All applications downloaded on employee mobile devices used for business
  purposes must be installed through a pre-approved app store or
  [application list](approved-software.md).

- Circumvention of built-in device security controls such as jailbreaking is
  strictly prohibited and enforced by detective or preventative software.

- Anti-malware software is installed and active on mobile devices. Alternatively,
  a sandbox environment is created on BYOD devices using the **Jamf**
  MDM solution to allow only white-listed application and data in a contained
  workspace.

- Any confidential or sensitive data is only allowed to be accessed via and
  stored inside the sandbox environment on mobile devices.

- Employees acknowledge that their mobile devices may be remotely controlled,
  locked or erased via the MDM software.

- Eligibility and usage of BYOD devices is subject to manager and/or IT/Security
  approval.
