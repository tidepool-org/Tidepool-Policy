### Work Site Recovery

In the event a Tidepool facility is not functioning due to a
disaster, employees will work from home or locate to a secondary site with
Internet access, until the physical recovery of the facility impacted is
complete. The recovery shall be performed by the facility management firm under
contract with Tidepool, and coordinated by the Facility Manager
and/or the Site Lead.

Tidepoolâ€™s software development organization has the ability to work
from any location with Internet access and does not require an office provided
Internet connection.
