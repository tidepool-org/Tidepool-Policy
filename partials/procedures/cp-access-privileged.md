### Privileged Access

Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts
before elevating the privilege or switching to privileged users and performing
privileged tasks.  Examples include:

* `sudo` in Linux/macOS
* `Run as Administrator` in Windows
* `Assume role` in AWS
