### Emergency Change

In the event of an emergency, the person or team on call is notified.  This may
include a combination or Development, IT, and Security.

If an emergency change must be made, such as patching of a zero-day security
vulnerability or recovering from a system downtime, and that the standard change
management process cannot be followed due to time constraint or personnel
availability or other unforeseen issues, the change can be made by:

* **Notification:** The Engineering Lead, Security Lead, and/or IT Lead must be
  notified by email, Slack, or phone call prior to the change . Depending on the
  nature of the emergency, the leads may choose to inform members of the
  executive team.

* **Access and Execution:** Manually access of the production system or manual
  deploy of software, using one of the following access mechanisms as defined in
  [Access Control policy and procedures](access.md):

    1. Support/Troubleshooting access
    2. Root account or root user access
    3. Local system access (for on-premise environment)

* **Post-emergency Documentation:** A PRODCM ticket should be created within 24
  hours following the emergency change.  The ticket should contains all details
  related to the change, including:

    * Reason for emergency change
    * Method of emergency access used
    * Steps and details of the change that was made
    * Sign-off/approvals must be obtained per the type of change as defined by
      the standard CM process

* **Prevention and Improvement:** The change must be fully reviewed by Security
  and Engineering together with the person/team responsible for the change.  Any
  process improvement and/or preventative measures should be documented and an
  implementation plan should be developed.
