### Security Events Analysis

Security logs, events, and audit trails are reviewed by the security team with
the assistance of automated systems and processes.

* Auditing logs are automatically analyzed and correlated by the monitoring
  solutions and/or a centralized security information and event management
  system.
* The systems are configured with rules/policies to identify suspicious
  activities, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
* Alerts are triggered upon identification of an issue based on the policy
  configuration.  
* The alerts are sent immediately to the responsible staff (e.g. security team)
  for analysis. The alerts may be sent via email, Slack messaging, or as
  notification on the monitoring dashboard.
* Analysis is prioritized based on alert severity.  High severity alerts are
  typically reviewed within 24 hours.
* Incident response process is followed, as needed.
* Patches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner.
