### Training, Education, Awareness and Responsibilities

1. Tidepool workforce members are provided training, education, and
   awareness on safeguarding the privacy and security of business and data.
   Tidepool's commitment to auditing access and activity of the
   information applications, systems, and networks is communicated through new
   employee orientation, ongoing training opportunities and events, and
   applicable policies. Tidepool workforce members are made aware of
   responsibilities with regard to privacy and security of information as well
   as applicable sanctions/corrective disciplinary actions should the auditing
   process detect a workforce member's failure to comply with organizational
   policies.

   Tidepool auditing capabilities. Platform Customers are responsible for the
   logging, auditing and retention of any application hosted outside of Tidepool
   environments, even though the applications may integrate with Tidepool

   will follow the auditing standards and procedures defined in this document.
