# System Audits, Monitoring and Assessments

`2020.1`

Tidepool shall audit, monitor, and assess the access and activity of
systems and applications that process or store production and/or sensitive data
such as personally identifiable information (PII)
and electronic protected health information (ePHI)
in order to ensure compliance.

It is required by the HIPAA Security Rule, that healthcare organizations to
implement reasonable hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that
record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

capabilities and resources. Tidepool shall make reasonable and
good-faith efforts to safeguard information privacy and security through a
well-thought-out approach to auditing that is consistent with available
resources.

It is the policy of Tidepool to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of applications, systems, and networks. To ensure that appropriate
safeguards are in place and effective, Tidepool shall audit access and activity
to detect, report, and guard against:

* Network vulnerabilities and intrusions;
* Breaches in confidentiality and security of sensitive information;
* Performance problems and flaws in applications;
* Improper alteration or destruction of sensitive information;
* Out of date software and/or software known to have vulnerabilities.

This policy applies to all Tidepool systems that store, transmit, or process
sensitive information.
