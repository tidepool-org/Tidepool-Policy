# Data Protection

`2020.1`

Tidepool takes the confidentiality and integrity of its customer data very
seriously. As stewards and partners of Tidepool Customers, we strive to assure
data is protected from unauthorized access and that it is available when needed.
The following policies drive many of our procedures and technical controls in
support of the Tidepool mission of data protection.

Production systems that create, receive, store, or transmit Customer data
(hereafter "Production Systems") must follow the requirements and guidelines
described in this section.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) Data must be handled and protected according to its classification
requirements and following approved encryption standards, if applicable.

(b) Whenever possible, store data of the same classification in a given data
repository and avoid mixing sensitive and non-sensitive data in the same
repository. Security controls, including authentication, authorization, data
encryption, and auditing, should be applied according to the highest
classification of data in a given repository.

(c) Workforce members shall not have direct administrative access to production
data during normal business operations.  Exceptions include emergency operations
such as forensic analysis and manual disaster recovery.

(d) All Production Systems must disable services that are not required to
achieve the business purpose or function of the system.

(e) All access to Production Systems must be logged, following the Tidepool
Auditing Policy.

(f) All Production Systems must have security monitoring enabled, including
activity and file integrity monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and/or malware
detection, as applicable.
