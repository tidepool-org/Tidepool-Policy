# Data Management Policy

`2020.1`

This policy outlines the requirements and controls/procedures Tidepool has
implemented to manage the end-to-end data lifecycle, from data
creation/acquisition to retention and deletion.

Additionally, this policy outlines requirements and procedures to create and
maintain retrievable exact copies of
electronic protected health information(ePHI),
PII and other critical customer/business data.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Tidepool. To
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive and critical data, both for
Tidepool and Tidepool Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that
data remains available when it needed and in case of a disaster.

## Policy Statements

(a) Data should be classified at time of creation or acquisition according to

by labeling or tagging the data.
