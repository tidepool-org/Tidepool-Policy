# Facility Access and Physical Security

`2020.1`

It is the goal of Tidepool to provide a safe and secure environment
for all employees. Access to the Tidepool facilities is limited to
authorized individuals only.

Tidepool works with Subcontractors (e.g. property management
companies and facilities management) to assure restriction of physical access to
systems used as part of the Tidepool Platform.

Physical Access to all of Tidepool facilities is limited to only
those authorized in this policy. All workforce members are
responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or
unauthorized access to Tidepool's facility.

Tidepool and its Subcontractors control access to the physical
buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which
Tidepool workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA
Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. In an effort to
safeguard ePHI from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed
to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for
unauthorized persons.
