### Patch Management Procedures

**Local Systems**

{{companyShortName}} uses automated tooling to ensure systems are up-to-date
with the latest security patches.

* On local Linux and Windows systems, the unattended-upgrades tool is used to
  apply security patches in phases.

    - High Risk security patches are automatically applied as they are released
    - Monthly system patching for regular applications are applied as needed.
    - Snapshotting of a system will take place before an update is applied.
    - Once the update is deemed stable the snapshot will be removed.
    - In case of failure of the update the snapshot will be rolled back.
    - If the staging systems function properly after the two-week testing
      period, the security team will promote that snapshot into the mirror used
      by all production systems. These patches will be applied to all production
      systems during the next nightly patch run.
    - The patching process may be expedited by the Security team
    - On Windows systems, the baseline Group Policy setting configures Windows
      Update to implement the patching policy.

**Cloud Resources**

{{companyShortName}} follows a "cattle-vs-pets" methodology to keep the
resources in the cloud environments immutable and up-to-date with security
patches.

* AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is used to dynamically manage container
  resources based on demand.  
  
* Engineering team builds security-approved AMI from the latest AWS optimized
  Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to include required security agent.

* The security agents installed on the security-approved AMIs continuously scan
  for and report new vulnerabilities.

* The custom AMIs are automatically rebuilt from the latest AWS AMIs weekly to
  include the latest security patches.

**User Endpoints**

{{companyShortName}} requires auto-update for security patches to be enabled for
all user endpoints, including laptops and workstations.

* The auto-update configuration and update status on all end-user systems are
  inspected by Security through either manual periodic audits or automated
  compliance auditing agents installed on the endpoints.
