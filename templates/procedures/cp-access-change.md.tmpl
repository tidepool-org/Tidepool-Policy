### Access Establishment, Modification and Termination

1. Requests for access to {{companyShortName}} Platform systems and applications is made
   formally using the following process:

    1. An access request is created in {{ticketingSystem}} through either the new employee
       onboarding request or a specific access request from {{companyShortName}} Internal
       Support site.
    1. The Security team will grant standard access to per job role as part of
       new employee onboarding. A standard set of accounts that are default for
       all employees are created as part of the onboarding process. This
       includes
       
        - User account for local system/laptop
        - Okta user in the Everyone group, and additional group based on role
          such as Development, IT, Security
        - Office365 account for access to Outlook email, SharePoint, etc.
        - Ataata account for security awareness training
        - HR accounts for paperwork, benefits management, payroll, expense
          reporting, etc.
        - {{ticketingSystem}} access for submitting support requests
        - Additional role based access (e.g. {{sourceControl}} and {{ciSystem}} access for a
          developer)
        
    1. Standard access may be provisioned at any time by account
       owners/administrators at any time during or after onboarding with
       approval of account owners and/or manager.
    1. If additional access is needed in addition to the above, a separate
       access request (through {{ticketingSystem}}) is required and the requester must include
       a description and justification as part of the access request.
    1. Once the review is completed, the Security team approves or rejects the
       Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and
       documentation.
    1. If the review is approved, IT or Security team provisions access, then
       marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
       
        * New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that
          meets all password requirements, which must be changed on the initial
          login.
        * All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.
        * For on-premise systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the
          appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP/AD group.
        * For cloud accounts, access grants are provisioned in Okta or using the
          access control mechanisms built into those services/applications.
        * Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a
          {{companyShortName}} employee at the discretion of the Security Officer.

1. Special access, including access to production environments, is not granted
   until receipt, review, and approval by the {{companyShortName}} Security Officer.
1. The request for access is retained for future reference.
1. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business
   purposes.

    * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not
      left unnecessarily.
    * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.

1. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content,
   identification and authentication may not be required.

#### Access Termination

IT Manager or Security team receives access termination requests in one of the
following conditions and processes it accordingly:

* Employee existing/termination, as defined by the process in 
  [HR & Employee Security](hr.md);
* Employee access to a system is no longer required as a result of job role
  change or similar event, in which case a access termination request may be
  submitted by the employee or his/her manager via the Internal Help portal or
  an email request to Security team;
* As the result of a Access Review, as defined in 
  [System Auditing](system-audit.md).
* Non-standard access is revoked by default after 30 days of inactivity, unless
  an exception/extension is requested and approved.
