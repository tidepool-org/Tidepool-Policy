### Risk Assessment and Analysis

The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and
vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of
this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating
risk.

* Step 1. System Characterization

    * The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To
      do this, identify where sensitive data is received, maintained, processed, or
      transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the {{companyShortName}} Platform
      boundaries are identified.

    * Output - Characterization of the {{companyShortName}} Platform system assessed, a good
      picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform
      boundaries.

* Step 2. Threat Identification

    * Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully
      exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All
      potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and
      data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a
      list of potential threats.

    * Output - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could
      exploit Platform vulnerabilities.

* Step 3. Vulnerability Identification

    * Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities
      that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources.
      Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that
      govern an organization's computer usage to insufficient safeguards to
      protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of
      software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization's
      computer network.

    * Output - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could
      be exercised by potential threat-sources.

* Step 4. Control Analysis

    * Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical
      controls that have been or will be implemented by {{companyShortName}} to minimize or
      eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a
      Platform vulnerability.

    * Output - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures,
      training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to
      mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the
      impact of such an adverse event.

* Step 5. Likelihood Determination

    * Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability
      that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the
      existing or planned security controls.

    * Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to
      the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 6. Impact Analysis

    * Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat
      successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems
      to consider should include the importance to {{companyShortName}}'s mission;
      sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss
      of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.

    * Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high
      (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 7. Risk Determination

    * Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood
      determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This
      represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or
      procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The
      risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for
      each risk level.

    * Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100).
      Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 8. Control Recommendations

    * Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as
      appropriate to the organization's operations to an acceptable level.
      Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of
      recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and
      regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and
      reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation
      process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security
      controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.

    * Output - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to
      mitigate risk.

* Step 9. Results Documentation

    * Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report,
      spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make
      decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and
      management changes.

    * Output - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and
      vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for
      control implementation.
