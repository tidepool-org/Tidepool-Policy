### Risk Management Objectives

{{companyShortName}} has established formal risk analysis and risk management
processes to

- identify risks that may impact its business operations or the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of its critical data; and

- reduce risk to an acceptable level by implementation of mitigation controls.

Unmitigated risk above the pre-defined acceptable level must be reviewed,
approved and accepted by senior management.

#### Acceptable Risk Levels

Risks that are either low impact or low probability, based on the scoring
mechanism defined in [risk assessment process](cp-risk-assess.md), are generally
considered acceptable.

All other risks must be individually reviewed and managed according to the
[risk management process](cp-risk-mgmt.md).
