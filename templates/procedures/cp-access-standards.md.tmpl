### Standards for Access Provisioning

#### Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information
   systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to
   carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job
   classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment,
   payment, or healthcare operations.
1. All access requests are treated on a "least-privilege" principle.
1. {{companyShortName}} maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.
   {{#needStandardHIPAA}}
   As such, {{companyShortName}}, including all workforce members, does not readily have
   access to any ePHI.
   {{/needStandardHIPAA}}

#### Access Authorization

1. Role based access categories for each {{companyShortName}} system and application are
   pre-approved by the Security Officer.
2. {{companyShortName}} utilizes hardware-defined and/or software-defined boundaries to
   segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of
   service attacks.

#### Person or Entity Authentication

1. Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that
   identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
1. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password or
   OpenID Connect that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
   This is enforced through the use of **AWS Cognito**.
1. All customer support interactions must be verified before {{companyShortName}} support
   personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.

#### Unique User Identification

1. Access to the {{companyShortName}} Platform systems and applications is controlled by
   requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and
   developer.
1. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).
1. Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in
   plain text.
1. Default accounts on all production systems and environments, including root,
   are disabled/locked.
1. Shared accounts are not allowed within {{companyShortName}} systems or networks.

#### Automatic Logon and Logoff

1. Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password
   entry are not permitted for use with {{companyShortName}} workstations or production
   systems.  

    * Automatic log-on may only be permitted for low-risk systems such as
      conference room PCs connecting to a Zoom Room.
    * Such systems are configured on separate network VLANs.

1. Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other
   individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected
   screen saver or logging off the system).
1. Information systems automatically lock users such as enabling
   password-protected screensaver after 2 minutes or less of inactivity.
1. Information systems automatically enter standby or log users off the systems
   after 30 minutes or less of inactivity.
1. The Security Officer must pre-approves any exception to automatic log off
   requirements.
