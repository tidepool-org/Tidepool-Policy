### Employee Issue Escalation

{{companyShortName}} workforce members are to escalate issues using the
procedures outlined in the Employee Quick Reference. Issues that are brought to
the Escalation Team are assigned an owner. The membership of the Escalation Team
is maintained by the Chief Executive Officer or his delegate.

Security incidents, particularly those involving sensitive data, are handled
using the process described in [Incident Response](ir.md). If the incident
involves a breach of sensitive data, the Security Officer will manage the
incident using the process described in [Breach Notification](breach.md). Refer
to [Incident Response](ir.md) for a list of sample items that can trigger
{{companyShortName}}'s incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether
the issue is a security incident, contact the Security team immediately.

It is the duty of the incident owner to follow the process outlined below:

1. Create an Issue in the {{ticketingSystem}} Security Project.
2. The Issue is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation
   is reached, it is moved to Review.
3. The Issue is reviewed by another member of the Escalation Team. If the Issue
   is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.
4. If the Issue is approved, it is marked as Done, adding any pertinent notes
   required.
5. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome
   via email.
