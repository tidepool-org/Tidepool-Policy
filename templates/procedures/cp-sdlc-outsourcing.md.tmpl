### Outsourced Software Development

{{companyShortName}} requires all outsourced software development to follow the
same rigor and process as internal engineering. Outsourced developers must
develop in our secure environment, accept and follow our security policies and
procedures, and comply with the same secure coding standards, including:

* Receive regular OWASP or equivalent secure coding training.

* Follow the same source control, code review, and security code scanning
  procedures as defined.

* Install endpoint compliance agent that checks to make sure firewall,
  encryption, patching, password policy, screensaver password, and other
  required protection is properly configured.

Additionally, the third party firm providing outsourced development services
must demonstrate that they have conducted the appropriate screening during
hiring.
