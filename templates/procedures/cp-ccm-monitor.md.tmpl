### Configuration Monitoring and Auditing

All infrastructure and system configurations, including all software-defined
sources, are centrally aggregated to a configuration management database (CMDB)
-- {{provider}}.

Configuration auditing rules are created according to established baseline,
approved configuration standards and control policies. Deviations,
misconfigurations, or configuration drifts are detected by these rules and
alerted to the security team.
