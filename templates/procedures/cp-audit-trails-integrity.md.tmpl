### Audit Trail Integrity - Security Controls and Log Retention

1. Audit logs shall be protected from unauthorized access or modification, so
   the information they contain will be made available only if needed to
   evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in
   this policy.
2. All audit logs are protected in transit and encrypted at rest to control
   access to the content of the logs.
3. Whenever possible, audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to
   minimize the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent
   access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges.

    * Separate systems are used to apply the security principle of "separation
      of duties" to protect audit trails from hackers.
    * {{companyShortName}} logging servers may include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
      (ELK) as part of their baseline configuration to ease reviewing of audit
      log data. The ELK toolkit provides message summarization, reduction, and
      reporting functionality.

4. Reports summarizing audit activities shall be retained for a period of seven
   years.
5. Audit log data is retained locally on the audit log server or in the source
   environment for a period of one month. Beyond that, log data is encrypted and
   moved to warm storage (currently S3) using automated scripts, and is retained
   for a minimum of one year.
6. Raw event data may be purged after one month / 30 days as long as the
   required details are sufficiently covered in aggregated audit logs/reports.
