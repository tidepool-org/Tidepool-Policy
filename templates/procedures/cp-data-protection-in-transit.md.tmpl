### Protecting Data In Transit

1. All external data transmission is encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys
   managed by {{companyShortName}}. This includes, but is not limited to, cloud
   infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.

2. Transmission encryption keys and systems that generate keys are protected
   from unauthorized access. Transmission encryption key materials are protected
   with access controls, and may only be accessed by privileged accounts.

3. Transmission encryption keys use a minimum of 4096-bit RSA keys, or keys and
   ciphers of equivalent or higher cryptographic strength (e.g., 256-bit AES
   session keys in the case of IPSec encryption).

4. Transmission encryption keys are limited to use for one year and then must be
   regenerated.

5. For all {{companyShortName}} APIs, enforcement of authentication, authorization, and
   auditing is used for all remote systems sending, receiving, or storing data.

6. System logs of all transmissions of Production Data access are kept. These logs must
   be available for audit.

#### Encryption of Data in Transit

All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using TLS
1.2 (a strong protocol), ECDHE_RSA with P-256 (a strong key exchange), and
AES_128_GCM (a strong cipher).

#### Data protection via end-user messaging channels

Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user
messaging channels such as email or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is
enabled.
