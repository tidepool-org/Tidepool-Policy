### Auditing and Assessment Tools

{{companyShortName}}'s Security Officer is authorized to select and use assessment tools
that are designed to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions. Use of such tools
against {{companyShortName}} systems and environments are prohibited by others, including
Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorization of the Security
Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to:

* Scanning tools and devices;
* Password cracking utilities;
* Network "sniffers";
* Security agents installed locally on servers and endpoints;
* Passive and active intrusion detection systems; and
* Penetration testing tools.

Vulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what
is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether
publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the
system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls.
