### BCDR Objectives and Roles

#### Objectives

The following objectives have been established for this plan:

1. Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established
   plan that consists of the following phases:

    * *Notification/Activation phase* to detect and assess damage and to
      activate the plan;
    * *Recovery phase* to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage
      done to the original system;
    * *Reconstitution phase* to restore IT system processing capabilities to
      normal operations.

2. Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out
   {{companyShortName}} processing requirements during prolonged interruptions
   to normal operations.

3. Identify and define the impact of interruptions to {{companyShortName}}
   systems.

4. Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for
   recovering {{companyShortName}} during prolonged periods of interruption to
   normal operations.

5. Ensure coordination with other {{companyShortName}} staff who will
   participate in the contingency planning strategies.

6. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will
   participate in the contingency planning strategies.

Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural
disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats,
and internal malicious activities.

{{companyShortName}} defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.

1. *Critical Systems*. These systems host production application
   servers/services and database servers/services or are required for
   functioning of systems that host production applications and data. These
   systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored,
   or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming
   unavailable.
2. *Non-critical Systems*. These are all systems not considered critical by
   definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and
   overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from
   functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a
   lower priority than critical systems.

#### Line of Succession

The following order of succession to ensure that decision-making authority for
the {{companyShortName}} Contingency Plan is uninterrupted. The Chief Operating
Officer (COO) is responsible for ensuring the safety of personnel and the

{{companyShortName}} technical environments. If the COO or Head of Engineering
is unable to function as the overall authority or chooses to delegate this
responsibility to a successor, the CEO shall function as that authority or
