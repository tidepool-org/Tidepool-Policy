### Password Reset and other Helpdesk Requests

{{companyShortName}} employees have the ability to obtain self-service support directly from
supported business applications, such as password reset via the SSO/IdP tool.

If needed, users may use our internal service desk or email request to obtain IT
and Security support.

A ticket is opened in {{ticketingSystem}} for each support request and assigned to the
appropriate personnel.  The person assigned must verify the identity of the
requester and ensure the ticket has appropriate approval before implementing or
providing support.  The verification step and confirmation of "User identity
verified" should be included as a comment in the ticket by the support
personnel. Additionally, if a password or security credential has been created
or supplied, confirm user has received it via another channel like
slack/email/phone/zoom and document receipt in the ticket.
