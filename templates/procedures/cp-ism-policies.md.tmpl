## Understanding the Policies and Documents

Policies are written in individual documents, each pertaining to a specific
domain of concern.

Each document starts with the current version number and/or last updated date,
followed by a brief summary.  The remaining of the document is structured to
contain two main sections:

* Policy Statements
* Controls and Procedures

All policy documents are maintained, reviewed, updated and approved following
standards and procedures outlined in [Policy Management](policy-mgmt.md).
