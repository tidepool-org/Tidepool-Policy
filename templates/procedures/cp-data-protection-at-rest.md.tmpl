### Protecting Data At Rest

#### Encryption of Data at Rest

All databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted with AES-256 using
separate keys for each storage type. The keys are rotated periodically.

#### Local Disk/Volume Encryption

Encryption and key management for local disk encryption of on-premise servers
and end-user devices follow the defined best practices for Windows, macOS, and
Linux/Unix operating systems, such as Bitlocker and FileVault.
