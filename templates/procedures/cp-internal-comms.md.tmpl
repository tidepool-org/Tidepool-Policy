### Internal Business Communications

#### Company-wide updates

{{companyShortName}} holds a company-wide roundtable at least quarterly to
communicate updates across all aspects of business operations, performance and
objectives.

Senior management sends out additional company-wide announcements as appropriate
through pre-established internal communication channels such as email or
messaging (e.g. Slack #general channel).

#### Departmental, team and/or project status updates

Regular performance and status updates are communicated by each department,
functional team, and/or designated individuals through pre-established channels.

Additionally, each project team maintains team updates at their own committed
cadence and channel -- for example, daily development standups/scrum or weekly
team meetings.
