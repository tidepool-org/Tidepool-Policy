### Protecting Data In Use

Data in Use, sometimes known as Data in Process, refers to active data being
processed by systems and applications which is typically stored in a
non-persistent digital state such as in computer random-access memory (RAM), CPU
caches, or CPU registers.

Protection of data in use relies on application layer controls and system access
controls. See the [Production Security / SDLC][1] and [Access][2] sections for
details.

{{companyShortName}} applications implement logical account-level data
segregation to protect data in a multi-tenancy deployment. In addition,
{{companyShortName}} applications may incorporate advanced security features
such as Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) modules and Attribute Based
Access Control (ABAC) for protection of data in use.
