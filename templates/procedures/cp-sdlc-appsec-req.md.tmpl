### High Level Application Security Requirements

All {{companyShortName}} software must be developed to include the following general
application security principles and requirements.  Web applications must also
protect itself against the [OWASP Top
10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2017_Release_Candidate)
vulnerabilities.

1. Protect sensitive customer data such as {{#needStandardHIPAA}}PHI, {{/needStandardHIPAA}}
   PII and account passwords. Encrypt data stored (at rest).

2. Secure data in transit and customer communications via TLS.

3. Provision strong access control (authentication and authorization). Prevent
   and report unauthorized access.

4. Log all transactions and activities to be able to tell who did what, when,
   where, and how. Mask or remove sensitive data in logs.

5. Implement client security at application endpoints (e.g. browser, mobile
   app).

6. Communicate securely across application endpoints and between service
  consumers/producers.

7. Use secure defaults to ensure security when in all error conditions.

8. Check and maintain the security of all third party and open source
   libraries/components/dependencies.

9. Validate all data inputs; encode data outputs when appropriate.

10. Deploy and configure applications securely to production.

11. Perform regular vulnerability analysis and apply security patches promptly.

12. Secure privileged access to production environments and ensure ongoing
    application monitoring.

All software code must complete a set of security scans/testing prior to being
deployed to production, including open source dependency scanning, static and
dynamic application security testing, as well as periodic penetration testing.

Pre-production testing is performed with nonproduction data in nonproduction
environments. Health checks are performed regularly or automated in production.

Software vulnerability identified through any of the above processes shall be
reported and tracked following {{companyShortName}} Vulnerability Management process
as defined in the [Vulnerability Management Policy and Procedures](vuln-mgmt.md).
