### Vulnerability Scanning and Infrastructure Security Testing

The scanning and identification of system vulnerabilities is performed by

1. Automated security agent installed on all Linux servers.

    * This includes physical and virtual servers hosted on premise as well as
      EC2 instances in AWS.
    * The agent automatically reports to a centralized management
      server/dashboard with details of the server instance and any vulnerability
      finding.
    * This assessment is performed on an ongoing basis.

2. Additionally, periodic security scans of {{companyShortName}} on-premise systems are done
   using a combination of open-source and commercial vulnerability testing
   tools, including:

    * OpenVAS
    * Nmap
    * OWASP ZAP
    * Burp Suite Pro

3. Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the {{companyShortName}}
   vulnerability management policy.

    * External penetration testing is performed continuously through a public
      vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program.
    * Additional external penetration testing is performed at least annually by
      either a certified penetration tester on {{companyShortName}} security team or an
      independent third party.
    * White-box internal penetration testing is performed at least quarterly by
      the security team.

4. {{companyShortName}} developed an internal vulnerability management tool/database used to
   track all system entities and associated vulnerabilities.

5. Findings from a vulnerability scan or penetration testing are analyzed by the
   security team, together with IT and Engineering as needed, and reported
   following the process as defined in the next section. A written report may be
   generated in addition to creating the findings in {{ticketingSystem}}.

6. All security testing reports and findings records are retained for 7 years.
