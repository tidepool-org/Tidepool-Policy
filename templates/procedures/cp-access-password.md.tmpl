### Password Management

1. User IDs and passwords are used to control access to {{companyShortName}} systems and may
   not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.
2. Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information
   system using another user's unique user ID and password.
3. On all production systems and applications in the {{companyShortName}} environment,
   password configurations are set to require:

    * a minimum length of 12 characters;
    * a mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or
      special characters;
    * a 60-day password expiration, or 60-day password expiration for
      administrative accounts;         
    * prevention of password reuse using a history of the last 24 passwords;
    * where supported, modifying at least 6 characters when changing passwords;
    * account lockout after 5 invalid attempts.

    !!! check "Exceptions"
    
        Password expiration may be set to a greater interval if an account is always protected by MFA. 
        Currently, {{provider}} SSO password rotation interval is set to 60 days.


4. All system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely.

    * Where possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a
      salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger NIST compliant standard).
    * Passwords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at
      rest pursuant to the requirements in [Data Protection](data-protection.md).
    * Transmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the
      requirements in [Data Protection](data-protection.md).

5. Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a
   pre-determined interval as determined by the system owner and/or Security,
   based on the criticality and sensitivity of the data contained within the
   network, system, application, and/or database.
6. Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee's termination (refer
   to the [Employee Termination Procedures in HR policy](hr.md)).
7. All default system, application, and Vendor/Partner-provided passwords are
   changed before deployment to production.
8. Upon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically
   generated for them.
9. Password change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user
   input errors.
10. All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.
11. If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to
    immediately report the incident to the 
    [Security team](mailto:security@{{companyEmailDomain}}).
12. In cases where a user has forgotten their password, password reset
    procedures provided by the IdP shall be followed. The exact process depends
    on the system or application. If help is needed, users shall contact [IT
    Support](mailto:itsupport@{{companyEmailDomain}}) or
    [Security](mailto:security@{{companyEmailDomain}})
13. An approved password manager is used for to store or share non-critical
    business application passwords that are not integrated with our primary IdP
    through SSO.

    * The password manager locally encrypts the password vault with the user's
      master password before synchronizing to the cloud.
    * The master password must follow the password requirements listed above.
    * MFA must enabled in the password manager configuration.
    * Enrollment of the password manager is configured as an application in
      {{provider}}.

14. An automated process/tool is implemented to ensure compromised passwords or
    common dictionary words are not used as passwords.  This is currently
    implemented in {{provider}}.
