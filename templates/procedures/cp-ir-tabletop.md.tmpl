### Tabletop Exercise

At least once per year, {{companyShortName}} security and engineering teams
jointly performs a Red Team exercise and/or a simulated "drill" of an emergency
cyberattack that results in one or more **CRITICAL** incidents. Depending on the
type of exercise, the duration may range from 2-4 hours (simulated "drill") to a
couple of weeks (full Red Teaming exercise).

The exercise will follow a cyberattack playbook. It may be conducted with all
internal resources or with the help of an external security consulting firm. The
goal of the exercise is to ensure all parties involved receive proper training
to handle an actual incident and to test out the documented procedures in order
to identify gaps ahead of a real event. Senior leadership team may be invited to
participate in the "drill" depending on the nature of the exercise or receive a
readout of the outcome.
