### Risk Management Process

Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of
{{companyShortName}}'s corporate compliance and information security program.

{{#needStandardHIPAA}}
{{companyShortName}}'s risk management process is developed in accordance with
the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the
Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA
Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B),
164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).
{{/needStandardHIPAA}}

Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:

  * Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are
    made to {{companyShortName}} physical and technical safeguards; and (Note that these
    changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of
    new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of
    new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the
    {{companyShortName}} Platform)
  * While making changes to {{companyShortName}} physical equipment and facilities that
    introduce new, untested configurations.

{{companyShortName}} performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the
security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or
operational changes affecting the security of sensitive data.

{{companyShortName}} implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and
vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:

  1. Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data
     {{companyShortName}} receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its
     Customers;
  2. Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the
     security or integrity of Customer data and/or sensitive data;
  3. Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer
     data and/or sensitive data that are not permitted or required; and
  4. Ensure compliance by all workforce members.

In addition, {{companyShortName}} risk management process requires that:

1. Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied,
   requires sign off by the senior management and {{companyShortName}}'s Security Officer.
2. All {{companyShortName}} workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all
   persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and
   audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be
   subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as
   outlined in the {{companyShortName}} Roles Policy.
3. The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security
   risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of {{companyShortName}}'s
   Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk
   Management Team.
4. All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put
   in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the
   documentation is maintained for six years.
5. The details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment,
   discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is
   tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:

    1. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management
       Procedures by creating an Issue in the {{ticketingSystem}} Security Project.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the
       Risk Management Procedures.
    3. All findings are documented and linked to the Issue.
    4. Once the Risk Assessment steps are complete, along with corresponding
       documentation, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the
       Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
    5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

6. The Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a quarterly basis using {{ticketingSystem}}
   reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

Third party risk management details including procurement and systems
acquisition can be found in [Â§vendor](vendor.md).

#### Risk Management Schedule

The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment
and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to
ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of {{companyShortName}}'s
information security program:

* Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of {{companyShortName}}'s information system
  infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be
  completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be
  determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.

* Throughout a System's Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a
  new, untested information system configuration and/or application is
  identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the
  potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as
  a part of the maintenance of the system.

* As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk
  Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to
  changes in business strategies, information technology, information
  sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that
  affect {{companyShortName}}'s Platform.

#### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

As required by GDPR, {{companyShortName}} performs a data protection impact
analysis as part of each risk assessment.
