### Internal/Manual Auditing Activities

Additional manual reviews, such as user accounts and access auditing, may be
necessary from time to time. These activities may be triggered by the events
listed above.

* Responsibility for audit activity is assigned to {{companyShortName}}'s Security Officer.
  The Security Officer shall:

    * Assign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the
      workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network;
    * Assign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member
      responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer,
      or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task;
    * Organize and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit
      compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sizes, report
      formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.).
    * All connections to {{companyShortName}} are monitored. Access is limited to certain
      services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created,
      are reviewed on an annual basis.

* The manual review process shall define and include:

    * Description of the activity as well as rationale for performing the audit.
    * Identification of personnel to perform the review (workforce members shall
      not review audit logs that pertain to their own system activity).
    * Frequency of the auditing process.
    * Determination of significant events requiring further review and
      follow-up.
    * Identification of appropriate reporting channels for audit results and
      required follow-up.

* Manual audits and reviews activities are tracked in {{ticketingSystem}}.

* Auditing, reviews and testing may be carried out internally or provided
  through an external third-party vendor. Whenever possible, a third party
  auditing vendor should not be providing the organization IT oversight services
  (e.g., vendors providing IT services should not be auditing their own services
  to ensure separation of duties).
