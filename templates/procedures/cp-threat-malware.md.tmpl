### System Malware Protection

1. All end-user workstations and production systems must have antivirus running.
   The default anti-malware solution used is {{provider}}. The anti-malware solution
   will include protection against malicious mobile code.

    * Next generation endpoint protection agent may be used as an equivalent solution.
    * Hosts are scanned continuously for malicious binaries in critical system
      paths. Additionally, if supported, the agent is set to to scan system
      every 2 hours and at reboot to assure no malware is present.
    * The malware signature database is kept up to date, changes are pushed
      continuously.
    * Logs of virus scans and alerts are maintained according to the
      requirements outlined in [System Auditing](system-audit.md).

2. Detected malware is evaluated and removed following the established [incident
   response process](ir.md).

3. All systems are to only be used for {{companyShortName}} business needs.
