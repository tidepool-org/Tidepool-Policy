### General Disaster Recovery Procedures

#### Notification and Activation Phase

This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage
inflicted by a disruption to {{companyShortName}}. Based on the assessment of
the Event, sometimes according to the {{companyShortName}} Incident Response
Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the COO or Head of
Engineering.  The Contingency Plan may also be activated by the Security Officer
in the event of a cyber disaster.

The notification sequence is listed below:

* The first responder is to notify the COO. All known information must be
  relayed to the COO.
* The COO is to contact the Response Teams and inform them of the event. The COO
  or delegate is responsible to begin assessment procedures.
* The COO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment
  procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated
  recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of
  unsafe conditions, the COO is to following the steps below.

    * Damage Assessment Procedures:
    * The COO is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the
      infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.
    * Alternate Assessment Procedures:
    * Upon notification, the COO is to follow the procedures for damage
      assessment with the Response Teams.

* The {{companyShortName}} Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the
  following criteria are met:

    * {{companyShortName}} will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.
    * On-premise hosting facility or cloud infrastructure service is damaged and
      will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.
    * Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by {{companyShortName}}.

* If the plan is to be activated, the COO is to notify and inform team members
  of the details of the event and if relocation is required.
* Upon notification from the COO, group leaders and managers are to notify their
  respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable
  information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.
* The COO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event
  has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage
  assessment) to the alternate site.
* The COO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the
  general status of the incident.
* Notification can be message, email, or phone.

#### Recovery Phase

This section provides procedures for recovering {{companyShortName}} infrastructure and
operations at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair
damage to the original system and capabilities.

Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in
the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.

Recovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild {{companyShortName}} infrastructure to a production
state.

The tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.

   DevOps
2. Assess damage to the environment - DevOps
3. Create a new production environment using new environment bootstrap
   automation - DevOps
4. Ensure secure access to the new environment - Security
5. Begin code deployment and data replication using pre-established automation -
   DevOps
6. Test new environment and applications using pre-written tests - DevOps
7. Test logging, security, and alerting functionality - DevOps and Security
8. Assure systems and applications are appropriately patched and up to date -
   DevOps

#### Reconstitution Phase

This section discusses activities necessary for restoring full
{{companyShortName}} operations at the original or new site. The goal is to
restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. If necessary,
when the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored,
{{companyShortName}} operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back.
The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate
site to the computer center.

1. Original or New Site Restoration

    * Repeat steps 5-9 in the Recovery Phase at the original or new site /
      environment.
    * Restoration of Original site is unnecessary for cloud environments, except
      when required for forensic purpose.

2. Plan Deactivation

    * If the {{companyShortName}} environment is moved back to the original site
      from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should
      be handled and disposed of according to the {{companyShortName}} Media
      Disposal Policy.
