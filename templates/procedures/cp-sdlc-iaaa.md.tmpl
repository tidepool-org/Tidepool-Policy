### Access Control of the Application (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

{{companyShortName}} external software application that is customer facing with
access to customer specific data, including sensitive information such as PII
{{#needStandardHIPAA}}and ePHI{{/needStandardHIPAA}}, implements strong access
control, covering the Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting/Auditing (IAAA) of access and user activity.

The implementation ensures that

- the user requesting access is the one claimed (Identification and
  Authentication);

- only users authorized to access specific data
  {{#needStandardHIPAA}}(such as ePHI){{/needStandardHIPAA}} are allowed to
  (Authorization); and

- their access activities are logs (Accounting/Auditing) according to the
  {{companyShortName}} auditing standards.

The current implementation leverages {{provider}} for user identity management
and access.  

The backend platform implements granular Attribute-Based
Access Control (ABAC) for granting access to specific services and data based on
the attribute(s) of a principal (i.e. user requesting access -- an attribute
could be the role or group membership or organization the user belongs to) and
the attribute(s) of the requested resource (i.e. data or service -- an attribute
could be the project this data belongs to).

More implementation details are documented on the internal Engineering wiki.
