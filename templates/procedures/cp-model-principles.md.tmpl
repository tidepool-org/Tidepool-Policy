### {{companyShortName}} Security Principles

#### (1) Data-centric model; zero-trust architecture

“Zero Trust” is a data-centric security design that puts micro-perimeters around
specific data or assets so that more granular rules can be enforced. It remedies
the deficiencies with perimeter-centric strategies and the legacy devices and
technologies used to implement them. It does this by promoting “never trust,
always verify” as its guiding principle. This differs substantially from
conventional security models which operate on the basis of “trust but verify.”

In particular, with Zero Trust there is no default trust for any entity —
including users, devices, applications, and packets—regardless of what it is and
its location on or relative to the corporate network. In addition, verifying
that authorized entities are always doing only what they’re allowed to do is no
longer optional; it’s now mandatory.

!!! Summary

    * No internal network. (Almost) 100% cloud.
    * Fully segregated with Granular policy enforcements.
    * Individually secured devices. No production access by default.

#### (2) “Air-Gapped” environments meet short-lived processes

We extend the zero-trust security model with a “Minimal Infrastructure”
approach, where we use “Anything-as-a-Service” whenever possible, to harness the
full power of the cloud. Cloud services allow us to contain and control access
at a much more granular level, compared to operating on-premise infrastructure.
Via access to the extensive APIs provided by the cloud services, we would be
able to more easily integrate and automate security operations. Additionally,
minimizing infrastructure significantly reduces always-on attack surfaces.
Services that are not used are turned off, instead of being idly available which
opens itself up to attacks. Together with Zero Trust, this security model and
architecture enables a high degree of flexibility for end-user computing while
maintaining the highest level of security assurance.

!!! Summary

    * No direct administrative or broad network connectivity into production.
    * Processes are short-lived and killed after use.
    * Minimal persistent attack surface making it virtually impenetrable.

#### (3) Least-privilege temporary access

Cyber attacks are inevitable. When it comes to preparing for potential attacks,
{{companyShortName}} security operations take the approach that assumes a compromise can
happen at any time, to any device, with little to no indicators. This is also an
extension of the “zero trust” model. When building security operations, we
carefully perform risk analysis and threat model, to identify potential single
point of compromise and to avoid having the “keys to the kingdom”.

In other words, compromise of any single system or user or credential, should
not easily lead to a broad or full compromise of the entire infrastructure or
operations. For example, if an attacker gains access to a admin credential (e.g.
Active Directory domain), it should not directly lead to the compromise of all
systems and data in the environment.

!!! Summary

    * Need-based access control for both employees and computing services.
    * Access to critical systems and resources are closed by default, granted on demand.
    * Protected by strong multi-factor authentication.
    * No “keys to the kingdom”; no single points of compromise.
    * "Secrets" (such as SSH Keys) must remain secret at all times.

#### (4) Immutable builds and deploys

The {{companyShortName}} platform leverages a micro-service architecture. This means that
the system has been decomposed into numerous small components that can be built
and deployed individually. Before these components get deployed to our
_production_ environments, we thoroughly test and validate the changes in our
_lower_ environments which are completely isolated from production. This allows
us to test upcoming changes while ensuring there is no impact to our customers.

As a particular build of a component progresses through our environments, it is
important that the build does not change thus we ensure that each build is
immutable. Once an _immutable build_ has been validated in our _lower_
(non-production) environments, we then deploy it to our _production_ environment
where the change will be available to {{companyShortName}} customers and end-users.

Changes to our infrastructure (database schema changes, storage buckets, load
balances, DNS entries, etc.) are also described in our source code and deployed
to our environments just like the applications. This architectural approach to
managing infrastructure is referred to as _infrastructure as code_ and is a key
requirement for fully automated deployments with minimal human touch.

!!! Summary

    * Infrastructure as code with active protection.
    * Automated security scans and full traceability from code commit to production.
    * “Hands-free” deployment ensures each build is free from human error or malicious contamination.

#### (5) End-to-end data protection and privacy

It is of the utmost importance that {{companyShortName}} provides for confidentiality (privacy), integrity
and availability of its customer's data. Your data is protected with end-to-end
encryption, combined with strong access control and key management. We also
prohibit our internal employees to access customer data directly in production.
So your data remains safe and private at all times. We will never use or share
your data without your prior consent.

We are proud to offer our customers data storage peace of mind with a money-back
guarantee. We guarantee your private data stored on our platform is always safe
and protected from cyberattacks such as ransomware, and we will reimburse you
for certain losses of such data due to unauthorized activity in eligible
accounts that resulted through no fault of your own.

!!! Summary

    * Data is safe both at rest and in transit, using strong encryption, access control and key management.
    * No internal user access is allowed to customer data in production.

#### (6) Strong yet flexible user access

We all know by now that "Passw0rd" makes a terrible password. Access control is
so important we must get it right. That's why we leverage tried-and-true
technology such as SAML, OAuth, multi-factor authentication, and fine-grained
authorization to provide strong yet intuitive access options, both for our
internal staff to access business resources and for our customers to access
{{companyShortName}} platform and services.

!!! Summary

    * OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML for customer authentication and single sign-on.
    * Multi-factor authentication.
    * Fine-grain attribute-based or role-based authorization.

#### (7) Watch everything, even the watchers

You can’t protect what you can’t see.

As the famous strategist, Sun Tzu, once said, “Know thy self, know thy enemy. A
thousand battles, a thousand victories.” It all starts with knowing ourselves.
This applies to the infrastructure, environments, operations, users, systems,
resources, and most importantly, data. It is important to inventory all assets,
document all operations, identify all weaknesses, and visualize/understand all
events.

This includes conducting various risk analysis, threat modeling, vulnerability
assessments, application scanning, and penetration testing. Not only that, this
requires security operations to keep an eye on everything, and someone should
also "watch the watchers".

At first, this would require significant manual effort and may seem impossible
to keep up-to-date. Our goal is to automate security operations, so that this
can be achieved programmatically as our operations evolve to become more
complex.

Additionally, {{companyShortName}} security team will actively monitor threat intelligence
in the community, with feeds and information sharing platform such as NH-ISAC to
stay abreast of the attacker activities and methodologies.

!!! Summary

    * All environments are monitored; All events are logged; All alerts are analyzed; All assets are tracked.
    * No privileged access without prior approval or full auditing.
    * We deploy monitoring redundancy to “watch the watchers”.

#### (8) Centralized and automated operations

As much as possible, {{companyShortName}} security will translate policy and compliance
requirements into reusable code for easy implementation and maintenance. This
allows us to truly be able to enforce policy and compliance in a fast and
scalable way, rather than relying solely on written policies and intermittent
manual audits. For example, end-point device policies may be translated into
Chef InSpec code and compliance may be enforced through the agent. Access
Control policies for production environments are translated into AWS IAM JSON
policies and implemented via Terraform code.

Automation makes it truly possible to centralize security operations, including
not only event aggregation and correlation, but also the orchestration and
management of previously siloed security controls and remediation efforts.

!!! Summary

    * API-driven cloud-native security fabric that
        - centrally monitors security events,
        - visualizes risk management,
        - automates compliance audits, and
        - orchestrates near real-time remediation.

#### (9) Usable security

Security benefits from transparency, and should operate as an open-book. This
allows the entire organization to take responsibility for and accountability of
adopting security best practices. Similar to code reviews and pull requests in
the development process, {{companyShortName}} security team makes security standards and
practices available to all employees for feedback prior to adoption.

We emphasize on the usability and practicality of security. A security solution
or process is not effective, if it is not being used, no matter how good it may
be. Having impractical security would only generate noise, provide a false sense
of security, and incur unnecessary cost. Nothing is perfect, but we embrace an
agile mindset to test and try, and to continuously improve.

!!! Summary

    * All employees receive security awareness training not annually, but monthly.
    * Simple policies, processes, and procedures.
    * No “Shadow IT”.
    * DevSecOps with common goals and an integrated team.
    * Processes that encourage self management and reward good behavior.

#### (10) Regulatory compliant and hacker verified

Security != Compliance. We cannot have one without the other.

!!! Summary

    * Regulatory Compliant;
    * Independently assessed and certified;
    * Hacker verified.
