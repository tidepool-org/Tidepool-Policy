### Media Disposal Process

IT and Security is responsible to ensure media containing critical / sensitive
data is disposed securely in the following manner:

* The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically,
  based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely
  and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.
  This may include

    - Secure wipe;
    - Physical destruction;
    - Destruction of encryption keys (if the data on the media is encrypted
      using a strong algorithm such as AES-256).

* If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or
  administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to
  ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly
  destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.

* All {{companyShortName}} Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract,
  they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In
  cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract
  limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent
  its return or destruction/disposal.

*  In the cases of a {{companyShortName}} Customer terminating a contract with
   {{companyShortName}} and no longer utilize {{companyShortName}} Services,
   data will be returned or disposed per contract agreement or
   {{companyShortName}} Platform use terms and conditions. In all cases it is
   solely the responsibility of the {{companyShortName}} Customer to maintain
   the safeguards required of laws and regulations once the data is transmitted
   out of {{companyShortName}} environments.
