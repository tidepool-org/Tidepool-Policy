### Remediation of Control Deficiencies

Most controls are continuously monitored and reported via automation on the
{{provider}} platform.

Control deficiencies identified as a result of an internal or external system
audit are documented and reviewed with management.

Security team works with the corresponding control owner to prioritize and
mitigate the control deficiency, including applying corrective actions,
implementating additional controls or adjusting existing controls as needed.
