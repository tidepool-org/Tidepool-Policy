### Review and Reporting of Audit Findings

1. Audit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely
   manner, at least monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s).
   Additional reviews are performed as needed to assure the proper data is being
   captured and retained.

2. The reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit
   findings to relevant workforce members, Customers, or Partners.

    * Significant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format.
      {{companyShortName}}'s security incident response form may be utilized to report a
      single event.
    * Routine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure
      in a written report format.

3. Reports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum
   necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally
   without administrative and/or legal counsel approval.

4. Security audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that
   may be included in {{companyShortName}}'s performance improvement activities and
   reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are
   disclosed to administrative-level oversight structures only and that
   information which may further expose organizational risk is shared with
   extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in
   organizational reports (individually-identifiable information shall not be
   included in the reports).

5. Whenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective
   actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with
   the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners.
