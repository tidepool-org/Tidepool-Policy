### Production Systems Provisioning

1. Before provisioning any systems, a request must be created and approved in
   the {{ticketingSystem}} Production Change Management (PRODCM) project.

    * {{ticketingSystem}} access requires authenticated users.
    * Security grants access to the {{ticketingSystem}} PRODCM project following the procedures
      covered in the [Access Establishment and Modification
      section](access.md).

2. The security team must approve the provisioning request before any new system
   can be provisioned, unless a pre-approved automation process is followed.

3. Once provisioning has been approved, the implementer must configure the new
   system according to the standard baseline chosen for the system's role.

4. If the system will be used to store sensitive information, the implementer
   must ensure the volume containing this sensitive data is encrypted.

5. Sensitive data in motion must always be encrypted.

6. A security analysis is conducted once the system has been provisioned.  This
   can be achieved either via automated configuration/vulnerability scans or
   manual inspection by the security team. Verifications include, but is not
   limited to:

    * Removal of default users used during provisioning.
    * Network configuration for system.
    * Data volume encryption settings.
    * Intrusion detection and virus scanning software installed.

7. The new system is fully promoted into production upon successful verification
   against corresponding {{companyShortName}} standards and change request approvals.
