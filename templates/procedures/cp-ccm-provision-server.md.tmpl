### Server Hardening Guidelines and Processes

1. **Linux System Hardening:** Linux systems have their baseline security
   configuration applied via automation tools. These tools cover:

    * Ensuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is
      configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.
    * Stopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.
    * Apply applicable DISA STIGs to OS and applications.
    * Configuring 15-minute session inactivity timeouts for SSH sessions.
    * Installing and configuring the virus scanner.
    * Installing and configuring the NTP daemon, including ensuring that
      modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.
    * Configuring disk volumes for providers that do not have native support for
      encrypted data volumes, including ensuring that encryption keys are
      protected from unauthorized access.
    * Configuring authentication to the centralized Directory Services servers.
    * Configuring audit logging as described in the [Auditing Policy
      section](system-audit.md).

1. **Windows System Hardening:** Windows systems have their baseline security
   configuration applied via the combination of Group Policy settings and/or
   automation scripts. These baseline settings cover:

    * Joining the Windows Domain Controller and applying the Active Directory
      Group Policy configuration (for AD-managed systems only).
    * Ensuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is
      configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.
    * Apply applicable DISA STIGs to OS and applications.
    * Stopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.
    * Configuring session inactivity timeouts.
    * Installing and configuring security protection agents such as anti-virus
      scanner.
    * Configuring transport encryption according to the requirements described
      in the [Mobile Device Security and Disposable Media Management
      section](mdm.md).
    * Configuring the system clock to point to approved NTP servers and ensuring
      that modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.
    * Configuring audit logging as described in the [Auditing Policy
      section](system-audit.md).

1. Any additional configuration changes applied to hardened Windows systems must
   be clearly documented by the implementer and reviewed by the Security team.
