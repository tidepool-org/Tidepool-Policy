### Types of System Audits

{{companyShortName}}'s auditing processes include the following.

1. **Configuration and Activity Monitoring:** This refers to the logging,
   monitoring, scanning and alerting of a system, account, or environment, which
   may be achieved using real-time automated scripts/software or a manual
   review/testing. This type of auditing is performed *continuously* as part of
   {{companyShortName}} operations.

    !!! tip "Examples include:"

        * User: User and account-level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.
        * Application: Application-level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.
        * System: System-level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, file integrity, and other system-defined specific actions.
        * Network: Network-level scans or audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, perform penetrations, and identify vulnerabilities.
        * Traffic: Traffic refers to the incoming and outgoing traffic into and out of production/restricted environments. For example, firewall logs or VPC flow logs in AWS.
        * Data: Data includes all successful and failed attempts at production data access and editing.

        *Data associated with above events will include origin, destination, action performed, timestamp, and other relevant details available.*

2. **Access Review:** This refers to the review of all user and service accounts
   and permissions across {{companyShortName}} operational environments, including
   on-premise systems, cloud environments such as AWS accounts, and other
   applications such as collaboration software, ticketing system and code repos.

    * {{companyShortName}} developed an internal tool to automatically pull configurations
      from our cloud based environments, including
        - AWS access configuration from IAM policies, EC2 VPC and security group
          settings, S3 bucket policies, Lambda and API Gateway resources, etc.;
        - Users, groups, application access from Okta IdP;
        - Network access settings from Cisco Meraki, etc.
    * The data is collected either on demand triggered by security team or by
      changes in the operational environment.
    * The data is used by the tool to aggregate and analyze user and application
      access.
    * Access to other systems and applications that are not covered by this
      automated tool are reviewed manually on a quarterly
      basis or with any significant change to the target environment.
    * As a result of each review, unused or invalid access will be removed.

3. **Compliance and Controls Audit:** This refers to the audit performed against
   the Technical, Administrative, and/or Physical controls as defined in
   {{companyShortName}} policies and procedures, to measure their adoption and
   effectiveness.  This type of auditing is typically performed by either a
   designated internal audit team or an external audit firm, at *defined
   intervals* or prompted by a *trigger event*.

    !!! tip "Potential trigger events include:"

        * Scheduled compliance audit/assessment (e.g. annual risk assessment)
        * High risk or problem prone incidents or events, or as part of post-incident activities
        * Business associate, customer, or partner complaints
        * Identification of significant security vulnerabilities
        * Atypical patterns of activity
        * Failed authentication attempts
        * Remote access use and activity
        * Activity post termination
        * Random audits
