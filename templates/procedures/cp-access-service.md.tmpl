### Service Accounts

* All application to application communication using service accounts is
  restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are
  used to limit account access across applications and systems.

* Services that are part of {{companyShortName}} platform leverage AWS IAM policy
  configurations and/or OAuth for authorization.

* Generic accounts are not allowed on {{companyShortName}} systems.

* Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application
  authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict
  access.

* In AWS, service accounts are implemented in the form of IAM Roles, and their
  access defined by the corresponding IAM policies. The creation of these IAM
  roles and policies is implemented as code, which follows the secure
  development, review and production change approval process.

* An inventory of all Service accounts is maintained by {{provider}} and
  reviewed periodically.
