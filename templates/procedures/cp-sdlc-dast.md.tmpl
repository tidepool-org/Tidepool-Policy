### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Dynamic testing is available by request to the Security team and is performed
using {{provider}}. Security team is currently looking into automation of
this type of scanning.

Additionally, manual baseline dynamic testing is available by request to the
Security team.

#### Integration of Dynamic testing into automatic tests
Upon availability of automatic UI tests for applications being developed
internally, an extension based on [OWASP
ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) is used to
transparently work with any UI tests available and automatically
add basic dynamic tests into build pipeline.
