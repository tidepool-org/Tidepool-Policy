### Physical Asset Inventory

{{companyShortName}} IT leverages a SaaS-based IT asset management system,
{{provider}}, to maintain inventory of all company
owned physical computing equipment, including but not limited to:

* servers
* workstations
* laptops
* printers
* networking equipment

Each record includes details of the physical device such as manufacturer, model
as well as ownership details and property tag ID.

The movement of computing hardware and electronic media is maintained as part of
the records, including media re-use and ownership reassignment.

{{companyShortName}} IT manager is responsible for ensuring each physical asset is applied
with a {{companyShortName}} property tag, and an up-to-date record is maintained in the IT
asset management system.

All company-owned devices are subject to a complete data wipe if deemed necessary, such as in the 
case of device infection or repurpose. This data wipe will be carried out by the IT manager.
