### Configuration and Provisioning of Management Systems

1. Provisioning management systems such as configuration management servers,
   remote access infrastructure, directory services, or monitoring systems follows
   the same procedure as provisioning a production system.

2. Critical infrastructure roles applied to new systems must be clearly
   documented by the implementer in the change request.
