### Office Network and Wireless Access

1. {{companyShortName}} production systems are not accessible directly over wireless
   channels.
2. Wireless access is disabled on all production systems.
3. When accessing production systems via remote wireless connections, the same
   system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other
   connections, including wired.
4. Wireless networks managed within {{companyShortName}} non-production facilities (offices,
   etc.) are secured with the following configurations:

    * All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;
    * Passwords are not currently on a rotation schedule because the office
      environments are considered insecure.  
    * Passwords are changed immediately should a suspicious activity or
      indicator of compromise is detected.
    * Guest wireless access is on a separate SSID configured with different
      password and traffic VLAN.
    * Wireless access is managed by the IT Manager.
    * Wireless access points connected to the network are automatically
      scanned; rogue access points identified are immediately removed.
