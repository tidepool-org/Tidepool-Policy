### Risk Mitigation and Monitoring

Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the
appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process
to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of {{companyShortName}} Platform
data. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the
risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.

* Step 1. Prioritize Actions

    * Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and
      vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order.
      This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with
      the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate
      attention and top priority in allocating resources

    * Output - Actions ranked from high to low

* Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options

    * Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are
      arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended
      control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and
      appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance,
      etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk
      mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end,
      select a "most appropriate" control option for each threat and
      vulnerability pair.

    * Output - list of feasible controls

* Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis

    * Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the
      benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent
      cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also
      identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in
      this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can
      greatly aid in the decision-making process.

    * Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not
      implementing each specific control

* Step 4. Select Control(s)

    * Taking into account the information and results from previous steps,
      {{companyShortName}}'s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team
      determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information
      systems and to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
      These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or
      technical safeguards.

    * Output - Selected control(s)

* Step 5. Assign Responsibility

    * Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each
      of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their
      responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other
      resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources
      may include time, money, equipment, etc.

    * Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments

* Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan

    * Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project
      plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The
      Implementation Plan should contain the following information:

        * Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;
        * Prioritized actions;
        * The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;
        * Required resources for implementation of selected controls;
        * Team member responsible for implementation of each control;
        * Start date for implementation
        * Target date for completion of implementation;
        * Maintenance requirements.

    * The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard
      implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource
      requirements (staff and other individuals' time, budget, etc.),
      interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information.
      Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success
      indicators should be reported to {{companyShortName}} Senior Management.

    * Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and
      contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet
      implementation timeframe and expectations. Additionally, consider
      including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a
      list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and
      project requirements.

    * Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan

* Step 7. Implement Selected Controls

    * As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that
      the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all
      risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented
      controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.

    * Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk
      Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people
      throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are
      identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate
      it.

    * Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major
      environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major
      facilities changes.

    * If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of
      the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower
      risk to an acceptable level can be identified.

    * Output - Residual Risk documentation
