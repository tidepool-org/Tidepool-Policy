### Certificate Management

{{companyShortName}} uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and LetsEncrypt for
certificate management.

- Certificates are renewed automatically.

- Security team monitors the certificates for expiration, potential compromise
  and use/validity. Certificate revocation process is invoked if the certificate
  is no longer needed or upon discovery of potential compromise.
