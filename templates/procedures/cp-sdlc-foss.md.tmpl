### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Security

{{companyShortName}} security and development team implemented a process to

  -  Inventory all software dependencies;
  -  Scan software dependencies for known security vulnerability;
  -  Fix any and all high risk findings prior to production; and
  -  Review and identify licensing issues of the 3rd party software and
     libraries.

The current tool in use is {{provider}}. {{provider}} supports Node.js, Ruby,
and Java. Documentation can be found at the {{provider}} website.

{{provider}} also enables automatic license analysis for dependencies, and this
functionality is embedded into the `securityScan()` {{ciSystem}} pipeline step.

{{provider}} can be leveraged in local development environment to scan locally
and/or at every build for dev to include dev dependencies.
