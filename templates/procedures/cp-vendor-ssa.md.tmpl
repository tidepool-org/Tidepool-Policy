### Software and Systems Acquisition Process

{{companyShortName}} Security maintains
a list of [pre-approved business software][1] and
a list of [approved vendors / contractors][2].

[1]: approved-software.md
[2]: approved-vendors.md

If additional commercial software, hardware system, or cloud services is needed,
a request should be submitted through {{companyShortName}} internal service
desk. This will trigger the approval by manager/security and procurement
process.

As applicable, {{companyShortName}} security team may conduct a risk analysis on
the software or system to ensure it complies with {{companyShortName}} security,
compliance and legal requirements and does not interfere with the security
controls. If a risk is identified, additional controls should be identified and
implemented (or planned) prior to acquisition. An alternative product may be
considered as a result of the risk analysis.
