### Monitoring Vendor Risks

Vendor contracts are reviewed either annually or according to the signed
contract duration.

Based on the risk level and the sensitivity/criticality of data the vendor has
access to, the vendor review may include an updated risk analysis performed by
the security team in addition to legal and business review of contract terms.

If the vendor is a service provider, the DevOps team monitors the service status
of the provider according to its SLA. This is done by either manually reviewing
the posted service status on the vendor's status pages at least quarterly, or by
setting up alarms for service interruption using automation.
