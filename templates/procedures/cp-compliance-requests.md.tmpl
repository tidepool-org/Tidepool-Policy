### Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports

{{companyShortName}}, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including
any Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) and exceptions, with customers on a case by case
basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in {{companyShortName}} format
between {{companyShortName}} and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested
by {{companyShortName}} workforce members for Customers or directly by {{companyShortName}} Customers.

The following process is used to request audit reports:

1. A request may be sent by email to
   [compliance@{{companyEmailDomain}}](mailto:compliance@{{companyEmailDomain}})
   or by submitting a request via {{companyShortName}} Internal Support Portal
   or Email. In the request, please specify the type of report being requested
   and any required timelines for the report.
2. An Issue with the details of the request into the {{companyShortName}} Security Project
   on {{ticketingSystem}}, which is used to track requests status and outcomes.
3. {{companyShortName}} security team will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the
   party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, {{companyShortName}} will
   send one for execution.
4. Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, {{companyShortName}} staff will move
   the {{ticketingSystem}} Issue to "Under Review".
5. The {{companyShortName}} Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the
   Issue. If the Issue is rejected, {{companyShortName}} will notify the requesting party
   that we cannot share the requested report.
4. If the Issue has been Approved, {{companyShortName}} will send the customer the requested
   audit report and complete the {{ticketingSystem}} Issue for the request.
