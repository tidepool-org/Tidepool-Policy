### Secure Design and Application Threat Modeling

{{companyShortName}} Security Team in collaboration with development team performs full
Application Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment on per-application basis using a
custom approach that relies on industry standards and best practices.

Major application updates are captured via an **RFC** process.  The RFC
template includes **Security Consideration** as a required section.  This 
section is used to document abuse cases including: 

- risks identified, 
- attack vectors, and 
- mitigating controls. 

Each RFC is required to capture sufficient details of the feature/component to
be developed, including use cases, motivation and outcome, and the following
design details as applicable:

- authentication/authorization mechanisms, 
- network communications, 
- data encryption,
- cloud services used,
- logging/auditing, 
- data flow diagram/description,
- edge cases, drawbacks, and alternatives.

The RFC must be approved prior to implementation.  Security team is included in
RFC reviews via the pull request process.
