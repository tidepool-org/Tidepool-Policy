### Incident Tracking and Records

A record is created for each reported incident in {{provider}}. Each incident
record contains details about the incident capturing the incident attributes
and progression, including the following as applicable:

- Summary
- Description
- Impact
- Priority / Urgency
- Categorization
- Analysis Notes and Comments
- Cause / Determination
- Outcome / Resolution
- Lessons Learned

If a more detailed post-mortem is applicable, the Security and/or DevOps team
will create the write-up and link it in the incident record.
