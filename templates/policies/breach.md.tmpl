# Breach Investigation and Notification

`{{defaultRevision}}`

{{#needStandardHIPAA}}
To provide guidance for breach notification when impressive or unauthorized
access, acquisition, use and/or disclosure of the ePHI occurs. Breach
notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for
vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule
applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health
records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required
by February 22, 2010.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on
February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security
Rules. While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health
information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business
associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation
process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI
to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23,
2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).
