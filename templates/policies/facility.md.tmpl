{{companyShortName}} and its Subcontractors control access to the physical
buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which
{{companyShortName}} workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA
Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. In an effort to
safeguard ePHI from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed
