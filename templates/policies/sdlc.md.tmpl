# Secure Software Development and Product Security

`{{defaultRevision}}`

{{companyShortName}} development team follows the latest security best practices when
developing software, and automates security testing throughout development
lifecycle whenever possible.

Security is integrated into all phases of {{companyShortName}} product development lifecycle,
including:

* Secure Design:

    - App Risk classification
    - Security req definition
    - Secure application design / RFC
    - Threat modeling
    - App data flow analysis

* Secure Development and Testing: 

    - Secure coding guidelines
    - Peer review
    - Security testing that includes:

        - Linting with security rules
        - Open source security analysis
        - Static secure code analysis
        - Dynamic security analysis
        - Penetration testing

    - Responsible vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program

* Remediation: 

    - Follows defined vulnerability management lifecycle
    - Ensures no high risk security vulnerability is in production

Details about the {{companyShortName}} software application architecture and
security are documented on the [product development / engineering wiki]({{&devWikiURL}}).

    (e.g. master branch); and
  * thorough product testing before releasing to production (e.g. unit testing
    and integration testing).

(c) Risk assessment activities (i.e. threat modeling) must be performed for a
new product or major changes to an existing product.

(d) Security requirements must be defined, tracked, and implemented.

(e) Security analysis must be performed for any open source software and/or
third-party components and dependencies included in {{companyShortName}} software products.

(f) Static application security testing (SAST) must be performed throughout
development and prior to each release.

(g) Dynamic application security testing (DAST) must be performed prior to each
release.

(h) All critical or high severity security findings must be remediated prior to
each release.

(i) All critical or high severity vulnerabilities discovered post release must
be remediated in the next release or within 30 days, whichever is sooner.

(j) Any exception to the remediation of a finding must be documented and
approved by the security team.
