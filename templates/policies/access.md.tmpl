## Policy Statements

### Access Control Policy

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that

(a) Access to all computing resources, including servers, end-user computing
devices, network equipment, services and applications, must be protected by
strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.

(b) Interactive user access must be associated to an account or login unique to
each user.

(c) All credentials, including user passwords, service accounts, and access
keys, must meet the length, complexity, age, and rotation requirements defined
in {{companyShortName}} security standards.

(d) Use strong password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible
to authenticate to all computing resources (including both devices and
applications).

(e) MFA is required to access any critical system or resource, including but not
limited to resources in {{companyShortName}} production environments.

(f) Unused accounts, passwords, access keys must be removed within 30 days.

(g) A unique access key or service account must be used for different
application or user access.

(h) Authenticated sessions must time out after a defined period of inactivity.

### Access Authorization and Termination

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that

(a) Access authorization shall be implemented using role-based access control
(RBAC) or similar mechanism.

(b) Standard access based on a user's job role may be pre-provisioned during
employee onboarding. All subsequent access requests to computing resources must
be approved by the requestor’s manager, prior to granting and provisioning of
access.

(c) Access to critical resources, such as production environments, must be
approved by the security team in addition to the requestor’s manager.

(d) Access must be reviewed on a regular basis and revoked if no longer needed.

(e) Upon termination of employment, all system access must be revoked and user
accounts terminated within 24 hours or one business day, whichever is shorter.

(f) All system access must be reviewed at least annually and whenever a user's
job role changes.

### Shared Secrets Management

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that

(a) Use of shared credentials/secrets must be minimized and approved on an
exception basis.

(b) If required by business operations, secrets/credentials must be shared
securely and stored in encrypted vaults that meet the {{companyShortName}} data encryption
standards.

(c) Usage of a shared secret to access a critical system or resource must be
supported by a complimenting solution to uniquely identify the user.

### Privileged Access Management

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that

(a) Users must not log in directly to systems as a privileged user.

  * A privileged user is someone who has administrative access to critical
    systems, such as a Active Directory Domain Administrator, root user to a
    Linux/Unix system, and Administrator or Root User to an AWS account.

(b) Privilege access must only be gained through a proxy, or equivalent, that
supports strong authentication (such as MFA) using a unique individual account
with full auditing of user activities.

(c) Direct administrative access to production systems must be kept to an
absolute minimum.
