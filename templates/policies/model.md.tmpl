# Security Architecture and Operating Model

`{{defaultRevision}}`

In the digital age, cyber attacks are inevitable. At {{companyShortName}}, we are taking a
“zero trust”, “minimal infrastructure” approach to managing risk and information
security.

This document describes our guiding principles in managing risk
and the building blocks of our security model.

## Policy Statements

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that:

(a) {{companyShortName}}'s security program and operations are designed and
implemented with the following objectives and best practices:

* All Tidepool security decisions are guided first by assessing patient risk
* data-centric, cloud-native
* trust but verify
* apply controls using least-privilege and defense-in-depth principles
* avoid single point of compromise
* automate whenever possible, the simpler the better, less is more
* prevent developer/engineering contraints with good security guardrails  

(b) Security and Privacy shall remain a top priority in all aspects of {{companyShortName}}'s
operations, support and product development.
