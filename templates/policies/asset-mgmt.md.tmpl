# Asset Inventory Management

`{{defaultRevision}}`

You can't protect what you can't see.  Therefore, it is imperative for {{companyShortName}}
to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of both its physical and
digital assets.

More details on data inventory and data lifecycle management is documented
separately in [Data Management](data-mgmt.md).

## Policy Statements

{{companyShortName}} policy requires that:

(a) IT and/or Security must maintain an inventory of all critical company
assets, both physical and logical.

(b) All assets should have identified owners and be tagged with a risk/data
classification.

(c) All physical assets must be labeled with a company property tag.
