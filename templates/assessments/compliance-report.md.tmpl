# {{companyShortName}} {{complianceStandard}} Compliance Report

`{{date}}`

## Executive Statement and Attestation

{{companyShortName}} has implemented an information security and risk management
program to protect our customers and information. We leverage JupiterOne to
manage our compliance program according to the controls and requirements
specified in {{complianceStandard}}.

More specifically, this includes:

1. managing and mapping corporate security policies and procedures to each
  control or requirement;

2. collecting and mapping implementation evidences to each control or
  requirement; and

3. if applicable, continuously monitoring the controls via automation -- using
   data, querying, and API integrations -- to identify potential misalignments
   and gaps.

Status of each {{requirementOrControl}} follows. There are three indicators
for each {{requirementOrControl}}, which each indicate the following:

- `Policies`: with (or without) linked policy and procedure documentation

- `Evidence`: with (or without) implementation evidence collected

- `Monitoring Status`: one of the following:

  - `Compliant`: the implementation fully fulfills this {{requirementOrControl}}
    with no gaps or issues identified and continuous monitoring is in place

  - `Attention`: potential remediation may be needed for a subset of data related
    to this {{requirementOrControl}}

  - `Gap`: gaps are detected and this {{requirementOrControl}} needs immediate
    remediation
  
  - `Unknown` or `Indeterminate`: review of implementation status and evidence
    is performed manually for this {{requirementOrControl}}

In summary, out of a total of {{totalRequirements}} {{requirementOrControl}}
in scope for this report, there are

- {{totalHasPolicies}} {{requirementOrControl}}s with defined and documented
  policies and procedures;

- {{totalHasEvidence}} {{requirementOrControl}}s with implementation evidences
  collected;

- {{totalDeterminate}} {{requirementOrControl}}s with
  continuous and automated monitoring in place;

- {{totalNotApplicable}} {{requirementOrControl}}s not applicable due to
  the nature of our business and technical operations.

Security and compliance is a continuous effort of risk reduction. As such, any
and all findings and gaps identified in this report are being assessed by our
security team for validation and remediation.

### Summary of Secure Development Practices

{{companyShortName}} development team follows security best practices in its
software development, and automates the security testing throughout development
lifecycle.  This includes:

- A peer review / pull request is required for each code merge
- Security requirements are documented, tracked, and implemented
- Unit testing to detect common security vulnerabilities when applicable, such
  as OWASP top ten list of application risks including cross-site scripting
- Vulnerability scanning of open source dependencies in all application code
- Static application security testing
- Dynamic application security testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Production deployment follows approved change management process
- All identified security findings are remediated in a timely manner, according
  to company policy

More details can be found in the Product Security and Secure Development policy
and procedures.

### Risk Assessment and Management

#### Annual Risk Assessment

{{#hasRiskAssessmentGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasRiskAssessmentGap}}
{{companyShortName}} Security team conducts an organization-wide risk assessment
every year. This annual risk assessment covers the identification and review of
both technical and non-technical risks, including the review of continuous /
automated security analysis, testing, and operational processes. Issues and gaps
identified are documented in the company Risk Registry.

#### Continuous Security Assessment

{{companyShortName}} Security team performs security assessment and testing on a
continuous basis, relying on both automated security tools and manual
penetration testing techniques.

#### Penetration Testing

{{#hasPenTestGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasPenTestGap}}
The last external testing {{companyShortName}}'s externally facing assets,
including its public websites and applications, was completed on
{{lastPenTestDate}} by {{lastPenTestProvider}}.

There were no critical findings. A formal report was produced listing all medium
and low severity findings in detail. The report was shared with accountable
owners and remediation actions have been taken and/or planned.

{{companyShortName}} conducts ongoing penetration testing upon any significant
change to the infrastructure or applications.  The penetration testing may be
internal or external, or both, depending on the type of change. Penetration
testing is conducted {{penTestFrequency}}.  The next scheduled testing is in
{{nextPenTestDate}}.

In addition, {{companyShortName}} maintains a responsible disclosure/bug bounty
program to capture and remediate security issues and findings promptly and
continuously.

#### Ongoing Risk and Vulnerability Management

All findings resulting from security testing, including penetration testing and
automated security scanning, are tracked in {{ticketingSystem}}.  The findings
include, more specifically:

- System vulnerabilities identified using the security agents installed on the
  hosts.
- Software vulnerabilities identified via ongoing static, dynamic, and open
  source application scanning.
- Misconfigurations and security issues, including malware incidents, from
  end-user computing devices (laptops and workstations).
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities including operating environments in the Cloud.

Note that the end-user devices are configured with auto-update enabled so that
they automatically receive critical security patches for both the operating
system and installed software applications as the patches become available.

Findings are reviewed by the security team and assigned to appropriate owners
for remediation. Most issues are addressed within 7-14 days.

### Training and Awareness

Security is everyone's responsibility. This is clearly defined in
{{companyShortName}} Roles and Responsibilities policy and communicated in the
Employee Handbook. As such, security and awareness training is a key component
of {{companyShortName}} information security program.

{{#hasInfoSecTrainingGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasInfoSecTrainingGap}}
All {{companyShortName}} employees are trained on the information security
policies and procedures as part of their onboarding. Additionally, ongoing
security awareness training is provided to ensure everyone understands and
follows security best practices.

The training records are captured within the HR record as part of onboarding and
the learning system.

## Gaps, Findings and Action Items

{{&gapSummary}}

{{&gapList}}

{{companyShortName}} security team operates with the principle of continuous
improvement. A few next steps have been planned on the near-term roadmap for
{{companyShortName}} security management and operations.

> [PLACEHOLDER]
> *List any action items.*

A detailed list of action items was created and tracked by the security team.

This assessment is not a one-time effort. {{companyShortName}} management and
security team is committed to conduct ongoing risk analysis, perform updated
security assessments and compliance audits, with major changes to its
infrastructure and/or operations, or at least once a year.
