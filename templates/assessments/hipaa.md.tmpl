- All employees have been through background checks.
- All employees are required to take annual HIPAA awareness and monthly security
  awareness training.
- Formal information security policies and procedures have been implemented.
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) are executed with all partners who handle
  protected health information (PHI) or electronic PHI (ePHI).

**HIPAA Technical Safeguards**

- Unique user identification is required and tracked for each individual user
  with access to ePHI.
- An emergency access and response plan is established.
- Inactive sessions to access ePHI automatically terminate / log off.
- Any internal access to ePHI requires strong passwords and second factor
  authentication.
- Access is granted with least-privilege and terminated when no longer needed
- All access to ePHI is monitored and logged.
- ePHI is de-identified both in storage and in transit using strong encryption.
- ePHI is stored in secure ransomware-proof repositories and replicated across
  geographical regions.

**HIPAA Physical Safeguards**

- Physical access to PHI or systems and devices that contain ePHI is controlled
  by two layers of key cards.
- Video security cameras are put in place for 24/7 monitoring.
- All physical media containing ePHI are encrypted with strong cryptographic
  algorithm at device level.
- Media is securely wiped or physically destroyed, and encryption keys destroyed
  prior to reuse or disposal.

{{companyShortName}} information security and data protection program will
continue to evolve and improve. We strive to provide the latest innovation in
security technology and best practices, to always stay ahead of the threats and

### Risk Assessment and Management

#### Annual Risk Assessment

{{#hasRiskAssessmentGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasRiskAssessmentGap}}
{{companyShortName}} Security team conducts an organization-wide risk assessment
every year. This annual risk assessment covers the identification and review of
both technical and non-technical risks, including the review of continuous /
automated security analysis, testing, and operational processes. Issues and gaps
identified are documented in the company Risk Registry.

#### Continuous Security Assessment

{{companyShortName}} Security team performs security assessment and testing on a
continuous basis, relying on both automated security tools and manual
penetration testing techniques.

#### Penetration Testing

{{#hasPenTestGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasPenTestGap}}
The last external testing {{companyShortName}}'s externally facing assets,
including its public websites and applications, was completed on
{{lastPenTestDate}} by {{lastPenTestProvider}}.

There were no critical findings. A formal report was produced listing all medium
and low severity findings in detail. The report was shared with accountable
owners and remediation actions have been taken and/or planned.

{{companyShortName}} conducts ongoing penetration testing upon any significant
change to the infrastructure or applications.  The penetration testing may be
internal or external, or both, depending on the type of change. Penetration
testing is conducted {{penTestFrequency}}.  The next scheduled testing is in
{{nextPenTestDate}}.

In addition, {{companyShortName}} maintains a responsible disclosure/bug bounty
program to capture and remediate security issues and findings promptly and
continuously.

#### Ongoing Risk and Vulnerability Management

All findings resulting from security testing, including penetration testing and
automated security scanning, are tracked in {{ticketingSystem}}.  The findings
include, more specifically:

- System vulnerabilities identified using the security agents installed on the
  hosts.
- Software vulnerabilities identified via ongoing static, dynamic, and open
  source application scanning.
- Misconfigurations and security issues, including malware incidents, from
  end-user computing devices (laptops and workstations).
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities including operating environments in the Cloud.

Note that the end-user devices are configured with auto-update enabled so that
they automatically receive critical security patches for both the operating
system and installed software applications as the patches become available.

Findings are reviewed by the security team and assigned to appropriate owners
for remediation. Most issues are addressed within 7-14 days.

### Training and Awareness

Security is everyone's responsibility. This is clearly defined in
{{companyShortName}} Roles and Responsibilities policy and communicated in the
Employee Handbook. As such, security and awareness training is a key component
of {{companyShortName}} information security program.

{{#hasHIPAATrainingGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasHIPAATrainingGap}}
All {{companyShortName}} employees have completed a HIPAA awareness training
within 30 days of onboarding or annual refresh training.

{{#hasInfoSecTrainingGap}}
> **GAP: must complete per statement below**

{{/hasInfoSecTrainingGap}}
All {{companyShortName}} employees are trained on the information security
policies and procedures as part of their onboarding. Additionally, ongoing
security awareness training is provided to ensure everyone understands and
follows security best practices.

The training records are captured within the HR record as part of onboarding and
the learning system.

## Gaps, Findings and Action Items

{{&gapSummary}}

{{&gapList}}

{{companyShortName}} security team operates with the principle of continuous
improvement. A few next steps have been planned on the near-term roadmap for
{{companyShortName}} security management and operations.

> [PLACEHOLDER]
> *List any action items.*

A detailed list of action items was created and tracked by the security team.

This assessment is not a one-time effort. {{companyShortName}} management and
security team is committed to conduct ongoing risk analysis, perform updated
security assessments and compliance audits, with major changes to its
infrastructure and/or operations, or at least once a year.
