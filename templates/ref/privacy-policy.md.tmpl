controlled by {{companyShortName}}.

This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your
personal information. If you do not agree with the data practices described in

We do not share information with third parties so that they can independently market their own products or services to you unless we have explicitly given you the option to opt-in such disclosures. We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party. <br /><br />[Learn more below](#how-we-share-your-information)
**Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information**     | We provide you with the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your information and to access, correct, update, oppose, delete, block, limit or object, upon request and free of charge, to our use of your Personal Information to the extent required by applicable law. <br /><br />[Learn more below](#your-rights-regarding-your-personal-information)
**Retention of your information**                       | We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. We keep your account data until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the [How We Use Your Information](#how-we-use-your-information) and [How We Share Your Information](#how-we-share-your-information) sections.
**Security of your information**                        | We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security ("TLS") to encrypt data transmission and Advanced Encryption Standard ("AES") to encrypt data storage. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

When you use our Services, we collect the
following types of information.

### INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US ("PERSONAL INFORMATION")

**ACCOUNT INFORMATION.** Some information is required to create an account on
Services, such as your

* name,
* email address,
* password,
* company, and
* phone number.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.** To help improve your experience or enable certain
features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional
information, such as

* a profile photo,
* biography,
* mailing address,
* country information,
* date of birth,
* gender,
* height,
* weight,
* additional health information or activity data such as your logs for food, weight, sleep, water,
* additional contact phone numbers such as your mobile telephone number,
* community or social media username, and
* messages on discussion boards or to your social contacts on the Services.

You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not
yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking
accounts or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your
contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.

If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect
the information you submit such as your name, email address, contact
information, and message.

**INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.** If you choose to connect your
account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive
information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or
Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range,
language, email address and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access
to your personal information such as activity data or health data from other
services. You can stop sharing the information from the other services with us
by removing our access to each other service.

**INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS.** While using our Services,
individuals may provide information about another individual, or an authorized
user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may
provide information about You. When one individual provides us with information
(including personal information) about another individual, we assume that the
individual has permission and authority to do so and to consent on behalf of
that individual to the collection and use of personal information as described
in this Privacy Policy. Please contact us immediately if you become aware of an
individual providing us with personal information about another individual
without being authorized to do so, and we will act consistently with this
Privacy Policy.

**PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION.** Some {{companyShortName}} Services
support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this
feature, you must provide certain information for identification and
verification, such as your name, billing address, credit, debit or other card
number, card expiration date and CVV code. This information is used solely to
check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We do not
store your payment information. We use a third-party service provider to manage
payment card processing. Note that third-party payment processors may retain
this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. This
service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use information you
provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.

### INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES

**USAGE AND DEVICE INFORMATION.** When you use our Services, we receive certain
usage data ("Usage and Device Information"). This includes information about
your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search
content, install or open applications or software, create or log into your
account, import data into your account, or integrate a third-party service to
your account. We may also collect data about the devices and computers you use
to access our Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language,
operating system, or mobile device information (including device and application
identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the
permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

**HEALTH AND OTHER SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA.** To the extent that
information we collect directly from you is health data or another special
category of sensitive personal data subject to the European Union’s General Data
Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), we ask for your explicit consent to process such
sensitive personal data. We obtain this consent separately when you take actions
leading to our obtaining the data, for example, when you activate the activity
tracking features in our Mobile Apps or grant us access to your health or
activity data from another service. You can use your account settings or contact
us to withdraw your consent at any time, including by stopping use of a feature,
removing our access to a third-party service, requesting deletion your data or
closing your account.  

However, if we are acting as a service provider (a "Data Processor") processing
your personal information on behalf of a third party that has collected such
data from you, and such third party is the party that has the right to determine
the purposes for which it will process your personal information and the means
it will use to process your personal information (the "Data Controller"), then
such Data Controller has the legal obligation to ask for your explicit consent
to process your sensitive personal data (including health data), and we are not
responsible for obtaining such consent from you.  In such a scenario, the Data
Controller may have their own, separate policies regarding the use and
disclosure of your personal information, including any sensitive personal data
you provide to such Data Controller.  In such a scenario, this Privacy Policy
does not apply to, we cannot control the activities of, and we are not
responsible for the activities of the applicable Data Controller generally; this
Privacy Policy only applies to our processing of your personal information that
we, as a Data Processor, have been asked to process on behalf of the Data
applicable Data Controller.  We encourage you to review such Data Controller’s
privacy policy and/or contact the applicable Data Controller for more
information about the policies that apply to their use and disclosure of your
personal information, including any sensitive personal data.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use the information we collect for the following purposes.

### PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES

We use the information we collect to deliver the Services to you and honor our
Terms of Service for each Service or business contract with you. For example,

* to administer, operate, maintain and secure our Services;
* to monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our
  Services;
* for accounting, recordkeeping, backup and administrative purposes;
* to customize and improve the content of our communications, websites and
  social media accounts;
* to provide customer service and support;
* to communicate with you, including responding to your comments, questions and
  requests regarding our Services;
* to process and complete transactions, and send you related information,
  including alerts and notifications about your service, purchase confirmations
  and invoices; and
* to educate and train our workforce in data protection and
  customer support.

For the Services’ social features, we may use your information to help you find
and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with
you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you
as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their
contact list or in their friend network on a connected service, we may show that
user that you are a user of the Services.

### IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES

We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to
develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and
protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and
surveys and develop new features and Services.

### COMMUNICATE WITH YOU

We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and
respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new
features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control
marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your
notification preferences in account settings or via the "Unsubscribe" link in an
email.

### PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY

We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the
Services, our users and other parties. For example, we may use the information

* to authenticate users;
* to facilitate secure payments;
* to respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms
  and policies;
* to investigate and protect against fraud, malicious or unauthorized access,
  and other illegal activities; and
* to demonstrate and verify compliance with our internal policies and
  procedures, and applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations,
  such as HIPAA and GDPR.

### USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION

"De-identified" means that we have removed, or rendered unreadable through
complex computational algorithms, your personally-identifiable information, such
as your name, address, or birthdate. We may use de-identified information that
we have obtained from our Services for various purposes, including for example:

* In accordance with regulatory requirements, we may de-identify, store and use
  your information for internal quality control, validation and research and
  development. This is important for {{companyShortName}} to maintain high
  quality Services. We may use de-identified information as permitted by law.
* We may contribute de-identified genetic variants that we have observed in the
  course of providing our Services to publicly available databases such as
  ClinVar. We do this to increase understanding and raise awareness of the
  significance of genetic variants within the medical and scientific
  communities.
* We may use or disclose de-identified information for general research and
  communications purposes. This may include analysis of this information to
  communicate observations and learnings, for example in the case of aggregated
  data. This may also include research collaborations with third parties, such
  as universities, hospitals or other laboratories, in which we utilize
  de-identified clinical cases, at the individual level or in the aggregate, in
  accordance with our study protocols, and we may present or publish such
  information. This may also include commercial collaborations with private
  companies for purposes such as to determine the prevalence of particular
  disorders or variants among the patients we have tested, or to determine
  whether any of the patients we have tested might be suitable for potential
  recruitment for research, clinical trials, or clinical care; however, we will
  not directly contact these patients about these opportunities without their
  prior written consent.

We use cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described above. For
more information, please read our [Cookie Policy]({{&cookiePolicyURL}}).

For personal data subject to the GDPR, we rely on several legal bases to process
the data. These include when you have given your consent, which you may withdraw
at any time using your account settings and/or other tools; when the processing
is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the Terms of Service; and our
legitimate business interests, such as in improving, personalizing, and
developing the Services, marketing new features or products that may be of
interest, and promoting safety and security as described above.

## HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances
described below.

### WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE

You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use
our social features in our Mobile Apps. For certain information, you may change
your privacy preferences in account settings and use other provided tools to
control how your information is visible to other users of the Services.

You may also authorize us to share your information with others, for example,
with a third-party application when you give it access to your account, or with
your employer company or other organizations and provide consent to each
organization. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by
their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with
third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account
settings.

### FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING

We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers and other
partners who process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with
this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer
support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis,
research and surveys.

### FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM

We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law,
regulation, legal process or governmental request; to assert legal rights or
defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect or investigate illegal
activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms or threats to the security of
the Services or the physical safety of any person. Please note: Our policy is to
notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search
warrants, court orders or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing
so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide
delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to
our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for
example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious
physical injury to a person. We may share non-personal information that is
aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an
individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for
example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under
agreement with us or as part of the community benchmarking information we
provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger,
acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the
confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice for the
transferring of any personal information to a new entity.

## YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can access and control your personal information via account settings and/or
our tools we provide to you, regardless of where you live. If you live in the
European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland (the “Designated
Countries”), you have a number of legal rights with respect to your information,
as outlined below.

**Accessing and Exporting Data.** By logging into your account, you can access
much of your personal information. Using your account settings or by contacting
us, you can also request a download information in a commonly used file format,
including data about your activities, body, foods and sleep.

**Editing and Deleting Data.** Your account settings and certain platform APIs
let you change and delete your personal information and/or account data. For
instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your
account if you wish.

If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your
information will be deleted within 14 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete
all of your information, such as the data stored in our backup systems. This is
due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also
preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in
the How We Share Your Information section.

**Objecting to Data Use.** You can control usage of your data via account
settings or other application APIs or tools. For example, you can

* limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services;
* limit the notifications you receive from us; and
* revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to
  your account.

If you live in a Designated Country, in certain circumstances, you can object to
our processing of your information based on our legitimate interests, including
as described in the How We Use Information section. You have a general right to
object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes. Please also
review our Cookie Policy for your options to control how we and our partners use
cookies and similar technologies for advertising.

**Restricting or Limiting Data Use.** In addition to the various controls that
we offer, if you reside in a Designated Country, you can seek to restrict our
processing of your data in certain circumstances. Please note that you can
always delete your account at any time.

Onward Transfers of Data.  If we intend to disclose your personal information to
any third party that will have the right to process it, we will enter into a
contract with that third party that provides that your personal information may
be processed only for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent
you have provided to us, and that the third party must provide the same level of
protection for your personal information that we are obligated to provide under
this Privacy Policy while it is processing your personal information.  In
addition, we will notify you if that third party will have the right to
determine the purposes for which it will process your personal information and
the means it will use to process your personal information (rather than just
providing requested assistance to us in support of our permitted uses of your
personal information).

**Changes to Privacy Policy.**  If we are using your personal information on the
basis of your consent, and we change our Privacy Policy to permit any use or
disclosure of your personal information that is materially different than the
uses for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you, we
will obtain your consent before we make such further uses of your personal
information.

**Further Assistance.**  If you need further assistance regarding your rights,
please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@{{companyEmailDomain}},
and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. If you
reside in a Designated Country and you are not satisfied with our response, you
will have a prompt, no-cost way of asserting your claim by contacting our chosen
independent dispute resolution body JAMS.  If you reside in a Designated
Country, you may have the right, under certain conditions, to invoke binding
arbitration, and, alternatively, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with
your local data protection authority or with the Irish Data Protection
Commissioner, our lead supervisory authority, whose contact information is
available here.
