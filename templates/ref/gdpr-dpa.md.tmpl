## Data Protection Addendum

This Data Protection Addendum (this "Addendum") is made and entered into as of
the date appearing on the signature page hereto (the "Effective Date") by and
between {{companyFullName}} ("Company") and the Supplier named on the signature page
hereto, and upon execution shall be incorporated by reference into each
agreement for services ("Services Agreement") pursuant to which Supplier may
Process (as defined below) Personal Data (as defined below) for, from, or on
behalf of Company.

### A. Personal Data Protection

For the purposes of this Addendum, the terms "Controller", "Data Subjects",
"Personal Data", "Personal Data Breach", "Processor" and "Process" shall have
the meaning as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 ("GDPR") or any
successor European Union data protection framework.

The parties agree that to the extent Supplier, in the context of performing the
agreed services, processes any Personal Data of Company, Supplier shall be the
Processor and Company shall be the Controller of such Personal Data.
Notwithstanding any obligations of Company as Controller under applicable data
protection law, Supplier undertakes the following as Processor:

(a) to process any Personal Data only on behalf and in accordance with Company’s
documented instructions and not for any purposes other than those described in
this Addendum, unless (i) Company has given its express prior consent or (ii)
Supplier is strictly required to do so under applicable European Data Protection
Law (as defined below); in such a case, Supplier shall inform Company of that
legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information
on important grounds of public interest. The subject-matter and duration of the
Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, the type of Personal Data
and the categories of Data Subjects are further specified in Exhibit 1 to this
Addendum.

(b) to comply with (i) the GDPR and any applicable European data protection laws
and regulations (collectively “European Data Protection Law”), and (ii), in case
Supplier is certified under the EU-U.S. and/or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Framework, or any successor program recognized under European Data Protection
Law to provide for an adequate level of data protection, the principles of such
applicable Privacy Shield Framework or successor program, and (iii) all other
applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations ((i) to (iii)
collectively “Data Protection Laws”).

(c) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a
manner that the Processing, including by any Sub-Processors (as defined below),
will meet the requirements under Data Protection Laws and ensure the protection
of the rights of the Data Subjects, and to regularly test, assess and evaluate
the effectiveness of and, as necessary, improve and update these measures. The
measures shall ensure a level of data security appropriate to the risks for the
rights and freedoms of the Data Subjects. In particular, Supplier shall protect
the personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or
alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise Processed.

(d) to keep Personal Data strictly confidential and to ensure, and be able to
demonstrate on request, that (i) only those persons have access to the Personal
Data who are authorized by Supplier and have a strict need to know the data for
the purposes under this Addendum, and (ii) all persons with access to Personal
Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
statutory obligation of confidentiality.

(e) to disclose Personal Data to third parties, including affiliated companies,
and/or to engage another Processor for the Processing of Personal Data
(“Sub-Processor”) only with Company’s express prior consent. Where Supplier is
authorized to engage another Sub-Processor for carrying out Processing
activities on behalf of Company, Supplier shall enter into a written contract
with the Sub-Processor which (i) imposes on the Sub-Processor the same data
protection obligations as set forth in this Agreement, in particular providing
sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational
measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements under
Data Protection Laws, and (ii) grants Company the right to directly audit the
Sub-Processor as set forth under Section A(j). Supplier shall promptly send a
copy of any sub-processor agreement it concludes under this Section A(e) to
Company. Supplier shall select the Sub-Processor diligently, taking into account
the technical and organizational measures it has implemented, and ensure, by
carrying out audits before and regularly after the commencement of the data
processing by such Sub-Processor, that it maintains appropriate technical and
organizational measures to safeguard an adequate level of data protection within
the meaning of European Data Protection Law. Supplier shall remain fully liable
to Company for the performance of this Agreement and be responsible and liable
for any act or omission of the Sub-Processor with respect to its data protection
obligations.

(f) to assist Company, including by appropriate technical and organizational
measures, insofar as this is possible and taking into the nature of the
processing, in fulfilling its obligations in relation to requests from Data
Subjects for exercising their Data Subject’s rights under Data Protection Laws,
including, but not limited to, the Data Subject’s right of access, right to
rectification and erasure, right to restriction of processing, right to data
portability and right to object, as provided for under the GDPR.

(g) to assist Company, taking into account the nature of the processing and
information available to Supplier, in ensuring compliance with the obligations
under applicable Data Protection Laws, including, in particular, by providing
all information and assistance to enable Company (i) to comply with applicable
data security obligations, (ii) to carry out a data protection impact assessment
or prior consultation with the supervisory authority, as required under European
Data Protection Law, and (iii) to respond promptly and properly to any enquiries
concerning the Processing of Personal Data and cooperate in good faith with the
supervisory authorities, the Data Subjects or any third party within a
reasonable time. Supplier shall not communicate with any supervisory authority,
Data Subject or any third party in connection with the Processing of Company's
Personal Data without prior approval from Company, except as expressly permitted
in this Section A.

(h) to notify Company, without undue delay, in writing or via e-mail (i) of any
intended change of the locations currently set out in Exhibit 1 to this Addendum
for the Processing of Personal Data, (ii) in case of a dispute, claim or request
brought by a Data Subject directly against Supplier, (iii) in the event of any
measure, request or other communication by a supervisory authority, including
about any legally binding request for access or disclosure of Personal Data by a
public authority (unless otherwise legally prohibited, in which case the
Supplier will use its best efforts to obtain the right to waive this
prohibition), and provide reasonable assistance if Company wishes to contest the
request, and (iv) of any suspected or actual Personal Data Breach, any breach of
applicable Data Protection Laws or of this Addendum. Supplier shall promptly
remedy any breach and cooperate with Company in the investigation and remedy of
such breaches and provide all reasonable assistance and information to enable
Company to comply with, or, as applicable, to avoid, any data breach
notification obligations vis-à-vis supervisory authorities and/or Data Subjects.
Supplier shall further immediately inform Company if, in its opinion, an
instruction infringes Data Protection Laws and/or Supplier becomes aware of the
existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the
guarantees and undertakings provided for under this Addendum.

(i) at the choice of Company, to return to Company (in a standard format
facilitating portability) and/or to securely delete/destroy all Personal Data,
including all existing copies thereof, in accordance with Company’s
instructions, within thirty (30) days upon Company’s request or after the end of
the provision of the services relating to Processing, and to certify to Company
in writing that it has done so. Supplier shall not be obliged to delete/destroy
all copies of the Personal Data where a longer storage by Supplier is required
under European Data Protection Law, in which case Supplier shall inform Company
accordingly, including about the legal grounds for, and the term of, any further
storage;

(j) to make available to Company all information necessary to demonstrate
compliance with the obligations under Data Protection Laws applicable to Company
and to allow for and contribute to audits, including on-site inspections,
conducted by Company or another auditor mandated by Company. (k) to enter into
any further agreements that may be required under Data Protection Laws relating
to Personal Data, and to provide all other assistance and support to Company.

### B. Changes to this Addendum

The parties agree that, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection
Laws, such as due to legislative changes, court decisions, and/or to reflect
measures or guidance from the competent supervisory authorities or the European
Commission, including, without limitation, the adoption of standards for

Directive 95/46/EC, such as, in particular, with respect to the EU Standard

reasonable changes or additions to this Addendum to reflect applicable
requirements.

### C. Third party beneficiary clause

enforce the terms of this Addendum against Supplier as third-party
beneficiaries.

Laws or this Addendum, Company, without prejudice to any other rights which it
may have, shall be entitled to terminate any Services Agreement forthwith. Any
terms of this Addendum that by their nature extend beyond the termination of the
