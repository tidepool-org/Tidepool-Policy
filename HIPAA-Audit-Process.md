## All devices accessing Tidepool data must use 2-factor authentication for Apple ID

Please upload a screenshot of your Apple ID settings:

`Apple - > System Settings -> AppleID -> Password and Security`

You can take a quick screenshot on Mac with `Command + Shift + 4` then draw around the window with your cursor. The screenshot will be saved to your Desktop folder

## 2-factor Authentication is required for all accounts that support it.

Tidepool Security enforces 2-factor via policy wherever poossible.

Employee Certifies that all system admin accounts will be protected with 2-Factor or MFA for all critical accounts and that keys will be stored in accordance with Tidepool’s password and authentication policies by adding your digital below (e.g. /s/ James Jellyfish 2023-030-02)

## All Tidepool devices must use `256-bit AES` encrypted storage locally. If you make backups to an external destination, please upload a screenshot of the encryption settings of that device. (e.g. for Time Machine)

** Note that that there is no requirement for backups, but if you require a device please contact security@tidepool.org and one will be provided.

`Apple - > System Settings -> General AppleID -> Time Machine`

## Find My Device - All devices that access Tidepool Data must have the location-based "Find My" features enabled, this includes phone, laptops and other mobile devices.

e.g. for Apple devices:
`Apple - > System Settings -> General AppleID -> iCloud -> Find my Mac`

> Please upload a screenshot of your `Find my device` settings.

## Antivirus or Anti-malware software is required for all computing devices (Windows, Mac OS or Linux) that access Tidepool data

Tidepool requires `BitDefender Endpoint Security` for all Tidepool-owned devices and this software will be provided to any employee that does not have it for BYOD devices.

> Non-Tidepool devices may use alternative anti-malware software. If you are using something different than Tidepool Bitdefender, please upload a screenshot of your software version definitions.

## Network Protection

To protect yourself and Tidepool, it is required not to use a Tidepool computing environment such as a laptop to run services exposed to the internet.

e.g. if you have a sophisiticated network, you may already run services for development and testing, but please exercise caution and protect your network appropriately.

> Please enter your digital signature below to agree not expose your Tidepool computing environment or network to public internet without security controls.

## Limiting PHI in Email Inbox

Since we have a BAA in place with Google, we can use Tidepool Gmail for PHI. However, we do not have a BAA in place with other email services (like SalesforceIQ or Boomerang) that may have access to your Gmail inbox. We DO have a BAA in place with ZenDesk. It’s just good practice to keep PHI out of your inbox in order to prevent accidental forwarding.

### Take these steps for your Tidepool Gmail account to keep emails with PHI out of your Inbox

#### When you send or forward an email that includes PHI, edit the subject line to preface it with “PHI”

Filtering PHI in Email:

- Setup a PHI mail filter that segregates email with PHI which should look as follows:

- In Gmail, go to Settings (the gear icon) -> Show All Settings -> Filters

`Subject:phi`

- Do this: Skip Inbox, Star it, Apply label `PHI` (or similar), Mark it as important

> Employee certifies they agree to use this filter for Tidepool inbox by uploading a screenshot of the filter including their tidepool account name, or sharing screen with auditor to capture a screenshot.

## Do you use any other service that reads your Tidepool email account (like RelateIQ or Boomerang)?

If you use a mail forwarding service, please enter it's name here
