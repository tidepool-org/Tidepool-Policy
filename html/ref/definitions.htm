compliance with security standards and policies at the Application Level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Audit</em>: Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity
(e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents). An audit may be done
as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of
employee wrongdoing.</p>

activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Audit Logs</em>: Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which
provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3)
identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of
activity.</p>

communicate data/ information or otherwise use any system resource.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Breach</em>: A data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure
or sensitive information to an untrusted environment or individual. A data
breach often involves an incident where information is stolen or taken from a
system without the knowledge or authorization of the system's owner.</p>
<p>Under HIPAA, a data breach means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure
of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the
Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose
of this definition, "compromises the security or privacy of the PHI" means
poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the
individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers
listed at ยง164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does
not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member
or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business
Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith
and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or
disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.</li>
<li>Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a
CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA,
or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the
information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or
disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.</li>
<li>A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an
unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably
have been able to retain such information.</li>

by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which
there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a
confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might
enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the
confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a
