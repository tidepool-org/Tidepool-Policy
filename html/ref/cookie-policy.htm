<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>Updated: </p>
<p>We at Tidepool (Tidepool Project and our subsidiaries and
affiliates) are committed to protecting your privacy. We and our partners use
cookies and similar technologies on our services, including our websites and
mobile applications (the "Services"). This Cookie Policy explains these
technologies, why we use them, and the choices you have.  </p>
<p>By visiting or using our Services, you are consenting to us gathering and
processing information (as defined in our <a href="https://tidepool.org/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>)
about you in accordance with this Cookie Policy.</p>
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES WE USE</h2>
<p>Like many Internet-enabled services, we use technologies that place small
files/code on your device or browser for the purposes identified in our
<a href="https://tidepool.org/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, primarily to remember things about you
so that we can provide you with a better experience.  </p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  A cookie is a small data file stored on your browser or device.
They may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting
("first-party cookies") or by other companies ("third-party cookies").</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, we partner with third-party analytics providers, like Google,
which set cookies when you visit our websites. This helps us understand how
you are using our Services so that we can improve them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pixels (Clear Gifs/Web Beacons/Web Bugs/Embedded Pixels).</strong> These are small
images on a web page or in an email. They collect information about your browser
or device and can set cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage.</strong> Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your
browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.</p>
<p><strong>Software development kits (“SDKs”).</strong> SDKs are blocks of code provided by our
partners that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us
understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain
information about the device and network you use to access the application.</p>

<h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
<p>You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use
cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising. Please note that
Tidepool websites and our Services do not respond to Do Not Track
signals because we do not track our users over time and across third-party
websites to provide targeted advertising. However, we believe that you should
have a choice regarding interest-based ads served by our partners, which is why
we outline the options available to you here below.</p>
<p>You can set your device or browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to
notify you in most situations that a cookie is offered so that you can decide
whether to accept it. However, if you block cookies, certain features on our
Services may not function. Additionally, even if you block or delete Cookies,
not all tracking will necessarily stop.</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install
Google's opt-out browser add-on.</li>
<li>For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of
receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit

targeted to your interests, use your Facebook, Pinterest, Google Ads, or the

interactions with the applications on your device. For example, on your iOS
