<h1>Security Architecture and Operating Model</h1>
<p><code>2022.08.26</code></p>
<p>In the digital age, cyber attacks are inevitable. At Tidepool, we are taking a
“zero trust”, “minimal infrastructure” approach to managing risk and information
security.</p>
<p>This document describes our guiding principles and aspirations in managing risk
and the building blocks of our security model.</p>
<h2>Policy Statements</h2>
<p>Tidepool policy requires that:</p>
<p>(a) Tidepool's security program and operations should be designed and implemented:</p>
<ol>
<li>to minimize the potential for patient risk</li>
<li>with the following objectives and best practices:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>data-centric, cloud-first architecture</li>
<li>assume compromise therefore never trust, always verify</li>
<li>apply controls using least-privilege and defense-in-depth principles</li>
<li>avoid single point of compromise</li>
<li>automate whenever possible, the simpler the better, less is more</li>
<li>prompt self management and reward good behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) Security shall remain a top priority in all aspects of Tidepool's business
operations and product development.</p>
