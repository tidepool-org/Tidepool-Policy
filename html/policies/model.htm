<h1>Security Architecture and Operating Model</h1>
<p><code>2022.10.14</code></p>
<p>In the digital age, cyber attacks are inevitable. At Tidepool, we are taking a
“zero trust”, “minimal infrastructure” approach to managing risk and information
security.</p>
<p>This document describes our guiding principles in managing risk
and the building blocks of our security model.</p>
<h2>Policy Statements</h2>
<p>Tidepool policy requires that:</p>
<p>(a) Tidepool's security program and operations are designed and
implemented with the following objectives and best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Tidepool security decisions are guided first by assessing patient risk</li>
<li>data-centric, cloud-native</li>
<li>trust but verify</li>
<li>apply controls using least-privilege and defense-in-depth principles</li>
<li>avoid single point of compromise</li>
<li>automate whenever possible, the simpler the better, less is more</li>
<li>prevent developer/engineering contraints with good security guardrails  </li>
</ul>
<p>(b) Security and Privacy shall remain a top priority in all aspects of Tidepool's
operations, support and product development.</p>
