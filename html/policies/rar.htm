<p>Security and compliance is everyone's responsibility.  Tidepool is committed to
ensuring all workforce members actively address security and compliance in their
roles. Statistically, cybersecurity breaches typically start with compromise of
end-user computing devices, social engineering, human error or insider threat.
Therefore, users are the first line of defense and yet usually the weakest link.
As such, training is imperative to assuring an understanding of current best
practices, the different types and sensitivities of data, and the sanctions
associated with non-compliance.</p>
