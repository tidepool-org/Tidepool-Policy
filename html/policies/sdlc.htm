<h1>Secure Software Development and Product Security</h1>
<p><code>2022.08.31</code></p>
<p>Tidepool development team follows the latest security best practices when
developing software, and automates security testing throughout development
lifecycle whenever possible.</p>
<p>Security is integrated into all phases of Tidepool product development lifecycle,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure Design:</p>
<ul>
<li>App Risk classification</li>
<li>Security req definition</li>
<li>Secure application design / RFC</li>
<li>Threat modeling</li>
<li>App data flow analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure Development and Testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure coding guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security testing that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linting with security rules</li>
<li>Open source security analysis</li>
<li>Static secure code analysis</li>
<li>Dynamic security analysis</li>
<li>Penetration testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsible vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follows defined vulnerability management lifecycle</li>
<li>Ensures no high risk security vulnerability is in production</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Details about the Tidepool software application architecture and
security are documented on the <a href="https://tidepool.atlassian.net/l/cp/PBK1MLhN">Tidepool Technical Documentation site</a> <a href="https://tidepool.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TE/overview">Tidepool/s Engineering internal wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>Policy Statements</h2>
<p>Tidepool policy requires that:</p>
<p>(a) Tidepool software engineering and product development is required to follow
security best practices. Product should be "Secure by Design" and "Secure by
Default".</p>
<p>(b) Quality assurance activities must be performed. This may include</p>
<ul>
<li>peer code reviews prior to merging new code into the main development branch
(e.g. master branch); and</li>
<li>thorough product testing before releasing to production (e.g. unit testing
and integration testing).</li>
</ul>
<p>(c) Risk assessment activities (i.e. threat modeling) must be performed for a
new product or major changes to an existing product.</p>
<p>(d) Security requirements must be defined, tracked, and implemented.</p>
<p>(e) Security analysis must be performed for any Open Source software and/or
third-party components and dependencies included in Tidepool software products.</p>
<p>(f) Security analysis must be performed before integrating SaaS or applications handling different levels of data classification.</p>
<p>(g) Integration between systems containing or processing PHI and systems that do not is prohibited without the approval of the Security Officer and Privacy officer. </p>
<p>(h) Static application security testing (SAST) should be performed throughout
development and prior to each release.</p>
<p>(i) Dynamic application security testing (DAST) should be performed prior to each
release.</p>
<p>(j) Open Source Library and license scanning must be performed prior to each release.</p>
<p>(k) All critical or high severity security findings must be remediated prior to
each release.</p>
<p>(l) All critical or high severity vulnerabilities discovered post release must
be remediated in the next release or within 30 days, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>(m) Any exception to the remediation of a finding must be documented and
approved by the security team or VP of Engineering.</p>
