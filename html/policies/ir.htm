<h1>Incident Response</h1>
<p><code>2022.09.09</code></p>
<p>Tidepool implements an information security incident response process to
consistently detect, respond, and report incidents, minimize loss and
destruction, mitigate the weaknesses that were exploited, and restore
information system functionality and business continuity as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The incident response process addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous monitoring of threats through intrusion detection systems (IDS) and
other monitoring applications;</li>
<li>Establishment of an information security incident response team;</li>
<li>Establishment of procedures to respond to media inquiries;</li>
<li>Establishment of clear procedures for identifying, responding, assessing,
analyzing, and follow-up of information security incidents;</li>
<li>Workforce training, education, and awareness on information security incidents
and required responses; and</li>
<li>Facilitation of clear communication of information security incidents with
internal, as well as external, stakeholders</li>
</ul>
