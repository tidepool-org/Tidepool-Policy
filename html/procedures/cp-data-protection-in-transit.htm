<h3>Protecting Data In Transit</h3>
<ol>
<li>All external data transmission is encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys
managed by Tidepool. This includes, but is not limited to, cloud
infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.</li>
<li>Transmission encryption keys and systems that generate keys are protected
from unauthorized access. Transmission encryption key materials are protected
with access controls, and may only be accessed by privileged accounts.</li>
<li>Transmission encryption keys use a minimum of 4096-bit RSA keys, or keys and
ciphers of equivalent or higher cryptographic strength (e.g., 256-bit AES
session keys in the case of IPSec encryption).</li>
<li>Transmission encryption keys are limited to use for one year and then must be
regenerated.</li>
<li>For all Tidepool APIs, enforcement of authentication, authorization, and
auditing is used for all remote systems sending, receiving, or storing data.</li>
<li>System logs of all transmissions of Production Data access are kept. These logs must
be available for audit.</li>

<h4>Encryption of Data in Transit</h4>
<p>All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using TLS
1.2 (a strong protocol), ECDHE_RSA with P-256 (a strong key exchange), and
AES_128_GCM (a strong cipher).</p>
<h4>Data protection via end-user messaging channels</h4>
<p>Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user
messaging channels such as email or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is
enabled.</p>
