<h3>Risk Mitigation and Monitoring</h3>
<p>Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the
appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process
to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Tidepool Platform
data. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the
risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1. Prioritize Actions</p>
<ul>
<li>Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and
vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order.
This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with
the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate
attention and top priority in allocating resources</li>
<li>Output - Actions ranked from high to low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options</p>
<ul>
<li>Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are
arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended
control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and
appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance,
etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk
mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end,
select a "most appropriate" control option for each threat and
vulnerability pair.</li>
<li>Output - list of feasible controls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the
benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent
cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also
identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in
this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can
greatly aid in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not
implementing each specific control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4. Select Control(s)</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking into account the information and results from previous steps,
Tidepool's mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team
determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information
systems and to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or
technical safeguards.</li>
<li>Output - Selected control(s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 5. Assign Responsibility</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each
of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their
responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other
resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources
may include time, money, equipment, etc.</li>
<li>Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project
plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The
Implementation Plan should contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;</li>
<li>Prioritized actions;</li>
<li>The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;</li>
<li>Required resources for implementation of selected controls;</li>
<li>Team member responsible for implementation of each control;</li>
<li>Start date for implementation</li>
<li>Target date for completion of implementation;</li>
<li>Maintenance requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard
implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource
requirements (staff and other individuals' time, budget, etc.),
interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information.
Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success
indicators should be reported to Tidepool Senior Management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and
contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet
implementation timeframe and expectations. Additionally, consider
including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a
list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and
project requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 7. Implement Selected Controls</p>
<ul>
<li>As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that
the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all
risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented
controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.</li>
<li>Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk
Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people
throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are
identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate
it.</li>
<li>Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major
environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major
facilities changes.</li>
<li>If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of
the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower
risk to an acceptable level can be identified.</li>
<li>Output - Residual Risk documentation</li>
</ul>
