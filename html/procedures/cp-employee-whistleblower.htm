<h3>Whistleblower Policy and Process</h3>
<p>The Tidepool requires all workforce members to observe high
standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and
responsibilities. All workforce members must practice honesty and integrity in
fulfilling their responsibilities and comply with all applicable laws and
regulations.</p>
<p>(a) Reporting Responsibility. Each workforce member is required and encouraged
to report serious concerns so that Tidepool can address and correct
inappropriate internal conduct and actions. This includes</p>
<ul>
<li>questionable or improper accounting or auditing matters,</li>
<li>violations and suspected violations of company policies or ethics, or</li>
<li>suspected violations of law or regulations that govern
Tidepoolâ€™s operations</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) Acting in Good Faith. Anyone filing a written complaint concerning a
violation or suspected violation must be acting in good faith and have
reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a
violation. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to
have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious
disciplinary offense.</p>
<p>(c) Confidentiality. Insofar as possible, the confidentiality of the
whistleblower will be maintained. However, identity may have to be disclosed to
conduct a thorough investigation, to comply with the law, and to provide accused
individuals their legal rights of defense.</p>
<p>(d) No Retaliation. Workforce members, in good faith, reporting a concern under
the Whistleblower Policy shall NOT be subject to retaliation or adverse
employment consequences. Moreover, any workforce member who retaliates against
someone who has reported a concern in good faith is subject to disciplinary
actions up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>(e) Reporting. Reports of concerns may be filed directly with the company CEO,
COO, and/or the Compliance Officer. Additional reporting procedure details can
be found in the employee handbook.</p>
