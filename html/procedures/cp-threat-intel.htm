<h3>Threat Intelligence Monitoring</h3>
<p>Tidepool Security team is subscribed to receive threat alerts from various third-parties and actively monitors CVE feeds for related vulnerabilities.</p>

party security solutions that have been implemented on the networks and/or
endpoints. The data gathered through these external intel feeds is automatically
used by the security solutions to analyze events and generate alerts.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Requirements Updates</strong></p>
<p>The Security and Privacy Officer actively monitors the regulatory compliance
landscape for updates to regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR.</p>
