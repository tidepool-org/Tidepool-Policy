<h3>Incident Management Process</h3>
<p>The Tidepool incident response process follows the process recommended by
<a href="https://www.sans.org">SANS</a>, an industry leader in security. Process flows are
a direct representation of the SANS process which can be found in <a href="sections/incident-flowchart.pdf">this
document</a>.</p>
<p>Tidepool's incident response classifies security-related events into the
following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Events</strong> - Any observable computer security-related occurrence in a system
or network with a negative consequence. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware component failing causing service outages.</li>
<li>Software error causing service outages.</li>
<li>General network or system instability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Precursors</strong> - A sign that an incident may occur in the future. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monitoring system showing unusual behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audit log alerts indicated several failed login attempts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspicious emails targeting specific Tidepool staff members with
administrative access to production systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alerts raised from a security control source based on its monitoring
policy, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Okta (user authentication activities)</li>
<li>Threat Stack (AWS Cloudtrail events or system agent activities)</li>
<li>Dome9 (cloud services configuration or access alerts)</li>
<li>Carbon Black Cb Defense (malware and endpoint events)</li>
<li>Syslog events from servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indications</strong> - A sign that an incident may have occurred or may be
occurring at the present time. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alerts for modified system files or unusual system accesses.</li>
<li>Antivirus alerts for infected files or devices.</li>
<li>Excessive network traffic directed at unexpected geographic locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incidents</strong> - A confirmed attack / indicator of compromise or a validated
violation of computer security policies or acceptable use policies, often
resulting in data breaches. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.</li>
<li>Unauthorized change or destruction of sensitive data.</li>
<li>A data breach accomplished by an internal or external entity.</li>
<li>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack causing a critical service to become
unreachable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tidepool employees must report any unauthorized or suspicious activity seen on
production systems or associated with related communication systems (such as
email or Slack). In practice this means keeping an eye out for security events,
and letting the Security team know about any observed precursors or indications
as soon as they are discovered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-info-Attention">Attention
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Incidents of a severity/impact rating higher than **MINOR** shall trigger the
following response process, or as defined more specifically in the **Incident
Categories and Playbooks** section.
</code></pre>
<h4>I - Identification and Triage</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Immediately upon observation Tidepool members report suspected and known
Events, Precursors, Indications, and Incidents in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct report to management, the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or
other;</li>
<li>Email;</li>
<li>Phone call;</li>
<li>Submit an incident report online via
<a href="https://tidepool.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=39&#x26;projectKey=SIR">Tidepool Internal ServiceDesk</a>;</li>
<li>Secure chat; or</li>
<li>Anonymously through workforce members desired channels.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual receiving the report facilitates the collection of additional
information about the incident, as needed, and notifies the Security Officer
(if not already done).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Security Officer determines if the issue is an Event, Precursor,
Indication, or Incident.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the issue is an event, indication, or precursor the Security Officer
forwards it to the appropriate resource for resolution.</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-Technical Event (minor infringement): the Security Officer of
designee creates an appropriate issue in https://tidepool.atlassian.net and further investigates
the incident as needed.</li>
<li>Technical Event: Assign the issue to an technical resource for
resolution. This resource may also be a contractor or outsourced
technical resource, in the event of a lack of resource or expertise in
the area.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the issue is a security incident the Security Officer activates the
Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and notifies senior leadership by
email.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a non-technical security incident is discovered the SIRT completes
the investigation, implements preventative measures, and resolves the
security incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II:
Containment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly
technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly
qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource
document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and
end times of all efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of an Incident
ticket in https://tidepool.atlassian.net Security Project and documents all findings and details
in the ticket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The intent of the Incident ticket is to provide a summary of all
events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and
procedures.</li>
<li>Each Incident ticket should contain sufficient details following
the <a href="https://www.sans.org/score/incident-forms/">SANS Security Incident Forms templates</a>,
as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or Tidepool representative appointed
notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners
are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy
Officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to
investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to Tidepool and
potentially external.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>II - Containment (Technical)</h4>
<p>In this Phase, Tidepool's engineers and security team attempts to contain the
security incident. It is extremely important to take detailed notes during the
security incident response process. This provides that the evidence gathered
during the security incident can be used successfully during prosecution, if
appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review any information that has been collected by the Security team or any
other individual investigating the security incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure the blast radius (i.e. a physical or logical network perimeter or
access zone).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the following forensic analysis preparation, as needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Securely connect to the affected system over a trusted connection.</li>
<li>Retrieve any volatile data from the affected system.</li>
<li>Determine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the
system up.</li>
<li>As necessary, take a snapshot of the disk image for further forensic;
and if appropriate, back up the system.</li>
<li>Change the password(s) to the affected system(s).</li>
<li>Determine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affect
system(s).</li>
<li>If it is safe, allow the system to continue to function; and move to
Phase V, Post Incident Analysis and Follow-up.</li>
<li>If it is NOT safe to allow the system to continue operations, discontinue
the system(s) operation and move to Phase III, Eradication.</li>
<li>The individual completing this phase provides written communication to
the SIRT.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any documentation relative to the security incident containment on the
Incident ticket, using
<a href="https://www.sans.org/media/score/incident-forms/IH-Containment.pdf">SANS IH Containment Form</a>
as a template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously apprise Senior Management of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as
needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>III - Eradication (Technical)</h4>
<p>The Eradication Phase represents the SIRT's effort to remove the cause, and the
resulting security exposures, that are now on the affected system(s).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen the defenses surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a
risk assessment may be needed and can be determined by the Security Officer).
This may include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An increase in network perimeter defenses.</li>
<li>An increase in system monitoring defenses.</li>
<li>Remediation ("fixing") any security issues within the affected system,
such as removing unused services/general host hardening techniques.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct a detailed vulnerability assessment to verify all the holes/gaps that
can be exploited have been addressed.</p>
<ol>
<li>If additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate
preventative measures to eliminate or minimize potential future
compromises.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the Incident ticket with Eradication details, using
<a href="https://www.sans.org/media/score/incident-forms/IH-Eradication.pdf">SANS IH Eradication Form</a>
as a template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the documentation with the information learned from the vulnerability
assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and the method used to fix the
problem with the affected system(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apprise Senior Management of the progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as
needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to Phase IV, Recovery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>IV - Recovery (Technical)</h4>
<p>The Recovery Phase represents the SIRT's effort to restore the affected
system(s) back to operation after the resulting security exposures, if any, have
been corrected.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The technical team determines if the affected system(s) have been changed in
any way.</p>
<ol>
<li>If they have, the technical team restores the system to its proper,
intended functioning ("last known good").</li>
<li>Once restored, the team validates that the system functions the way it
was intended/had functioned in the past. This may require the involvement
of the business unit that owns the affected system(s).</li>
<li>If operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s)
had been taken offline or dropped from the network while triaged),
restart the restored and validated system(s) and monitor for behavior.</li>
<li>If the system had not been changed in any way, but was taken offline
(i.e., operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor
for proper behavior.</li>
<li>Update the documentation with the detail that was determined during this
phase.</li>
<li>Apprise Senior Management of progress.</li>
<li>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates
as needed.</li>
<li>Move to Phase V, Follow-up.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>V - Post-Incident Analysis (Technical and Non-Technical)</h4>
<p>The Follow-up phase represents the review of the security incident to look for
"lessons learned" and to determine whether the process that was taken could have
been improved in any way. It is recommended all security incidents be reviewed
shortly after resolution to determine where response could be improved.
Timeframes may extend to one to two weeks post-incident.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Responders to the security incident (SIRT Team and technical security
resource) meet to review the documentation collected during the security
incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "lessons learned" section is written and attached to Incident ticket.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the cost and impact of the security incident to Tidepool using
the documents provided by the SIRT and the technical security resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine what could be improved. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems and processes adjustments</li>
<li>Awareness training and documentation</li>
<li>Implementation of additional controls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate these findings to Senior Management for approval and for
implementation of any recommendations made post-review of the security
incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out recommendations approved by Senior Management; sufficient
budget, time and resources should be committed to this activity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure all incident related information is recorded and retained as described
in Tidepool Auditing requirements and Data Retention standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the security incident.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Periodic Evaluation</h4>
<p>It is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident
response should be periodically reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness. This
also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security
incidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding the
Tidepool's expectation for them, relative to security responsibilities. The
incident response plan is tested annually.</p>
