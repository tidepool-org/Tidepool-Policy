<h3>Protecting Data At Rest</h3>
<h4>Encryption of Data at Rest</h4>
<p>All databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted with AES-256 using
separate keys for each storage type. The keys are rotated periodically.</p>
<h4>Local Disk/Volume Encryption</h4>
<p>Encryption and key management for local disk encryption of on-premise servers
and end-user devices follow the defined best practices for Windows, macOS, and
Linux/Unix operating systems, such as Bitlocker and FileVault.</p>
