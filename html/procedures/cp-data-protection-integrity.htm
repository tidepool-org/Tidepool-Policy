<h3>Data Integrity Protection</h3>
<p>When appropriate, Tidepool engineering should implement "Versioning"
and "Lifecycle", or equivalent data management mechanism, such that direct edit
and delete actions are not allowed on the data to prevent accidental or
malicious overwrite. This protects against human errors and cyberattacks such as
ransomware.</p>
<p>In AWS, the IAM and S3 bucket policy in production will be implemented
accordingly when the environments are configured. When changes must be made, a
new version is created instead of editing and overwriting existing data.</p>
<ul>
<li>All edits create a new version and old versions are preserved for a period of
time defined in the lifecycle policy.</li>
<li>Data objects are "marked for deletion" when deleted so that they are
recoverable if needed within a period of time defined according to the data
retention policy.</li>
<li>Data is archived offsite -- i.e. to separate AWS account and/or region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, all access to sensitive data is authenticated, and audited via
logging of the infrastructure, systems and/or application.</p>
