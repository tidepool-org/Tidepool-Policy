<h3>Data Deletion Procedures</h3>
<h4>For Platform Customers</h4>
<p>Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Tidepool understands and
appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a
subcontractor/service provider, and at times a business associate, Tidepool is
not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth
by each state.</p>
<p>Tidepool has created and implemented the following procedures to
make it easier for Tidepool Customers to support data retention
laws.</p>
<p>Some types of customer data may be automatically transitioned to a storage class
that is appropriate for archival or infrequent usage. The guidelines for
transitioning data to different storage classes is at the discretion of
Tidepool.</p>
<p>Customer data is retained for as long as the account is in active status. Data
enters an expired state when the account is voluntarily closed. Expired account
data will be retained for 14 days. After 14 days, the project/account and
related data will be removed. Customers that wish to voluntarily close their
account should download their data manually or via the API prior to closing
their account.</p>
<p>If an account is involuntarily suspended, then there is a 14 day grace period
during which the account will be inaccessible but can be re-opened if the customer
meets their payment obligations and resolves any terms of service violations. If
a customer wishes to manually backup their data in a suspended account, then
they must ensure that their account is brought back to good standing so that the
API and user interface will be available for their use. After 14 days, the
suspended account will be closed and the data will be permanently removed
(except when required by law to retain).</p>
<h4>For patient data as as a Covered Entity</h4>
<p>Tidepool is NOT a covered entity.  Should we become a covered entity in the
future, we would be required by law to retain healthcare records for up to 10
years beyond when service was last provided when providing healthcare services
directly to patients. Any patient data that is marked for deletion will be
archived for the time required by law. This archived data can be retrieved by
the customer as long as it is retrieved within 10 years from date of last
service.</p>
