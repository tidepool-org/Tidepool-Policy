<h3>Audit Trail Integrity - Security Controls and Log Retention</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Audit logs shall be protected from unauthorized access or modification, so
the information they contain will be made available only if needed to
evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in
this policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All audit logs are protected in transit and encrypted at rest to control
access to the content of the logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever possible, audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to
minimize the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent
access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate systems are used to apply the security principle of "separation
of duties" to protect audit trails from hackers.</li>
<li>Tidepool uses Sumo Logic to provide Logging as a Service</li>
<li>Tidepool logging servers may include Kibana and other monitoring stacks
as part of their baseline configuration to ease reviewing of audit
log data. The ELK toolkit provides message summarization, reduction, and
reporting functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports summarizing audit activities shall be retained for a period of seven
years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audit log data is retained locally on the audit log server or in the source
environment for a period of one month. Beyond that, log data is encrypted and
moved to warm storage (currently S3) using automated scripts, and is retained
for a minimum of one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw event data may be purged after one month / 30 days as long as the
required details are sufficiently covered in aggregated audit logs/reports.</p>
</li>
