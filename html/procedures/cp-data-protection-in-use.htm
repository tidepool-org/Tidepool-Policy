<h3>Protecting Data In Use</h3>
<p>Data in Use, sometimes known as Data in Process, refers to active data being
processed by systems and applications which is typically stored in a
non-persistent digital state such as in computer random-access memory (RAM), CPU
caches, or CPU registers.</p>
<p>Protection of data in use relies on application layer controls and system access
controls. See the <a href="sdlc.htm">Production Security / SDLC</a> and <a href="access.htm">Access</a> sections for
details.</p>
<p>Tidepool applications implement logical account-level data
segregation to protect data in a multi-tenancy deployment. In addition,
Tidepool applications may incorporate advanced security features
such as Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) modules and Attribute Based
Access Control (ABAC) for protection of data in use.</p>
