<h3>Patch Management Procedures</h3>
<p><strong>Cloud Resources</strong></p>
<p>Tidepool follows a "cattle-vs-pets" methodology to keep the
resources in the cloud environments immutable and up-to-date with security
patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used to dynamically manage container
resources based on demand.  </li>
<li>AWS manages patching of the Kubernetes control plane and underlying virtual infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Endpoints</strong></p>
<p>Tidepool requires auto-update for security patches to be enabled for
all user endpoints, including laptops and workstations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The auto-update configuration and update status on all end-user systems are
inspected by Security through either manual periodic audits or automated
compliance auditing agents installed on the endpoints.</li>
</ul>
