<h2>Understanding the Policies and Documents</h2>
<p>Policies are written in individual documents, each pertaining to a specific
domain of concern.</p>
<p>Each document starts with the current version number and/or last updated date,
followed by a brief summary.  The remaining of the document is structured to
contain two main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy Statements</li>
<li>Controls and Procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>All policy documents are maintained, reviewed, updated and approved following
standards and procedures outlined in <a href="policy-mgmt.htm">Policy Management</a>.</p>
