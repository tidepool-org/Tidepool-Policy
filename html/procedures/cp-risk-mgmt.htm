<h3>Risk Management Process</h3>
<p>Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of
Tidepool's corporate compliance and information security program.</p>
<p>Tidepool's risk management process is developed in accordance with
the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the
Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA
Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B),
164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).</p>
<p>Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are
made to Tidepool physical and technical safeguards; and (Note that these
changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of
new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of
new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the
Tidepool Platform)</li>
<li>While making changes to Tidepool resources or assets that
introduce new, untested configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tidepool performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the
security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or
operational changes affecting the security of sensitive data.</p>
<p>Tidepool implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and
vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data
Tidepool receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its
Customers;</li>
<li>Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the
security or integrity of Customer data and/or sensitive data;</li>
<li>Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer
data and/or sensitive data that are not permitted or required; and</li>
<li>Ensure compliance by all workforce members.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, Tidepool risk management process requires that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied,
requires sign off by the senior management and Tidepool's Security Officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All Tidepool workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all
persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and
audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be
subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as
outlined in the Tidepool Roles Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security
risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Tidepool's
Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk
Management Team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put
in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the
documentation is maintained for six years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment,
discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is
tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management
Procedures by creating an Issue in the https://tidepool.atlassian.net Security Project.</li>
<li>The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the
Risk Management Procedures.</li>
<li>All findings are documented and linked to the Issue.</li>
<li>Once the Risk Assessment steps are complete, along with corresponding
documentation, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the
Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a quarterly basis using https://tidepool.atlassian.net
reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Risk Management Schedule</h4>
<p>The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment
and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to
ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Tidepool's
information security program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of Tidepool's information system
infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be
completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be
determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.</li>
<li>Throughout a System's Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a
new, untested information system configuration and/or application is
identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the
potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as
a part of the maintenance of the system.</li>
<li>As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk
Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to
changes in business strategies, information technology, information
sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that
affect Tidepool's Platform.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)</h4>
<p>As required by GDPR, Tidepool performs a data protection impact
analysis as part of each risk assessment.</p>
