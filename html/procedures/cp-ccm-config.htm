<h3>Configuration Management Processes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Configuration management is automated using industry-recognized tools like
Terraform to enforce secure configuration standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are
reviewed and approved by Security team before they are implemented to assure
they comply with business and security requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in
production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized
personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooling is used to generate an up to date system inventory.</p>
<ul>
<li>All systems are categorized and labeled by their corresponding
environment, such as <em>dev</em>, <em>test</em>, and <em>prod</em>.</li>
<li>All systems are classified and labeled based on the data they store or
process, according to <a href="assets/data-classification-and-handling.pdf">Tidepool data classification
model</a>.</li>
<li>The Security team maintains automation which monitors all changes to IT
assets, generates inventory lists, using automatic IT assets discovery,
and services provided by each cloud provider.</li>
<li>IT assets database is used to generate the diagrams and asset lists
required by the Risk Assessment phase of Tidepool's
<a href="risk-mgmt.htm">Risk Management procedures</a></li>
<li>Tidepool Change Management process ensures that all asset inventory
created by automation is reconciled against real changes to production
systems. This process includes periodic manual audits and approvals.</li>
<li>During each change implementation, the change is reviewed and verified by
the target asset owner as needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tidepool uses only approved and hardened containers in support of Tidepool Production</p>
<ul>
<li>EC2 instances in AWS are provisioned using only hardened and approved
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).</li>
<li>Docker containers are launched using only approved Docker images that have
been through security testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>All IT assets in Tidepool have time synchronized to a single
authoritative source.</p>
<ul>
<li>All systems are configured to point to a common NTP server.</li>
<li>The internal NTP server and all AWS instances are pointing to the same set
of ntp servers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>All frontend functionality (e.g. user dashboards and portals) is separated
from backend (e.g. database and app servers) systems by being deployed on
separate servers or containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All software and systems are required to complete full-scale testing before
being promoted to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All code changes are reviewed to assure software code quality, while in
development, to proactively detect potential security issues using
pull-requests and static code analysis tools.  More details can be found in
the <em>Software Release / Code Promotion</em> section.</p>
