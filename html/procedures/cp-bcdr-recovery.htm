<h3>General Disaster Recovery Procedures</h3>
<h4>Notification and Activation Phase</h4>
<p>This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage
inflicted by a disruption to Tidepool operations. Based on the assessment of
the Event, sometimes according to the Tidepool Incident Response
Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by the VP of Engineering, COO or CEO.  The Contingency Plan may also be activated in the event of a cyber disaster.</p>
<p>The notification sequence is listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first responder is to notify the VP of Engineering. All known information must be relayed to the VP of Engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VP of Engineering is to contact the Response Teams and inform them of the event. The VP of Engineering
or delegate is responsible to begin assessment procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VP of Engineering is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment
procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated
recovery time. </p>
<ul>
<li>Damage Assessment Procedures:</li>
<li>The VP of Engineering is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether digital
infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.</li>
<li>Alternate Assessment Procedures:</li>
<li>Upon notification, the VP of Engineering is to follow the procedures for damage
assessment with the Response Teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tidepool Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the
following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidepool will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.</li>
<li>On-premise hosting facility or cloud infrastructure service is damaged and
will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Tidepool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the plan is to be activated, the VP of Engineering is to notify and inform team members
of the details of the event and if relocation is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon notification from the VP of Engineering, group leaders and managers are to notify their
respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable
information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VP of Engineering is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the
general status of the incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification can be message, email, or phone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recovery Phase</h4>
<p>This section provides procedures for recovering Tidepool infrastructure and
operations at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair
damage to the original system and capabilities.</p>
<p>Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in
the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.</p>
<p>Recovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Tidepool infrastructure to a production
state.</p>
<p>The tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact Partners and Customers affected to begin initial communication -
Operations</li>
<li>Assess damage to the environment - Operations and Backend</li>
<li>Create a new production environment using new environment bootstrap
automation - Operations and Backend</li>
<li>Ensure secure access to the new environment - Security</li>
<li>Begin code deployment and data replication using pre-established automation -
Operations and Backend</li>
<li>Test new environment and applications using pre-written tests - Operations, QA, and Backend</li>
<li>Test logging, security, and alerting functionality - Operations and Security</li>
<li>Assure systems and applications are appropriately patched and up to date -
Backend and Operations</li>
<li>Update DNS and other necessary records to point to new environment - Operations and Security</li>
<li>Update Partners and Customers affected through established channels - Operations and Security</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reconstitution Phase</h4>
<p>This section discusses activities necessary for restoring full
Tidepool operations at the original or new site. The goal is to
restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. If necessary,
when the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored,
Tidepool operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back.
The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate
site to the computer center.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Original or New Site Restoration</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat steps 5-9 in the Recovery Phase at the original or new site /
environment.</li>
<li>Restoration of Original site is unnecessary for cloud environments, except
when required for forensic purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan Deactivation</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Tidepool environment is moved back to the original site
from the alternative site, all digital infrastructure used at the alternate site should
be handled and decommissioned according to the Tidepool Media
Disposal Policy.</li>
</ul>
