<h3>Security Architecture</h3>
<p>Tidepool developed a security architecture on top of its three main
infrastructure environments - Cloud (AWS), DevOps, and workforce collaboration /
end-user computing.</p>
<h4>Architecture Diagrams</h4>
<p>Detailed architecture diagrams of the in-scope networks, endpoints, applications
as well as the security operations are developed and maintained by JupiterOne.</p>
<h4>Cloud Architecture</h4>
<h5>Cloud Native</h5>
<ul>
<li>Designed for the cloud using true multi-tenant architecture</li>
<li>Auto scaling across multiple data centers in multiple regions around the world</li>
<li>Tidepool services deployed inside private subnets of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</li>
<li>Comprehensive security and compliance via AWS certifications</li>
<li>Ongoing security testing by AWS and AWS customers</li>
</ul>
<h5>Customer Benefits</h5>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure is tailored to our customer's goals and usage patterns</li>
<li>"Shared use" model reduces cost</li>
<li>Nearly infinite compute and data capacity via AWS cloud provider</li>
<li>Customers can focus on solving business problems and not worry about infrastructure</li>
<li>Automatic backup and recovery</li>
<li>Continuous improvements via change control process</li>
<li>Faster adoption of new technology</li>
</ul>
<h5>Evolution of Cloud Computing</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Baremetal</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer in someone else's data center</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual Machine</p>
<ul>
<li>A portion of a computer in someone else's data center</li>
<li>In AWS, a Virtual Machine is created from Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Container</p>
<ul>
<li>A package of essential application libraries and code but not
the core OS libraries - Simpler to scale a docker image because - No
duplication of core OS processes (networking, filesystem, etc) - Typically
a Docker container nad in Tidepool's case is running inside Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function</p>
<ul>
<li>Just the application code that runs in a pre-built container</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tidepool strives to leverage Kubernetes running managed in AWS as the primary building
blocks for our platform because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure can be fully managed as code within Github, our source code management platform</li>
<li>Managed Kubernetes (EKS on AWS) eliminates the need to operate and secure our own control plane</li>
<li>Kubernetes allows us full visibility and auditability for all applications and services</li>
<li>Application updates can be deployed constantly for security and maintainability with no interruption to services</li>
</ul>
