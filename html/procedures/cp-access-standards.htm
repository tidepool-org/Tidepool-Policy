<h3>Standards for Access Provisioning</h3>
<h4>Workforce Clearance</h4>
<ol>
<li>The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information
systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to
carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job
classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment,
payment, or healthcare operations.</li>
<li>All access requests are treated on a "least-privilege" principle.</li>
<li>Tidepool maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.
As such, Tidepool, including all workforce members, does not readily have
access to any ePHI.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Access Authorization</h4>
<ol>
<li>Role based access categories for each Tidepool system and application are
pre-approved by the Security Officer.</li>
<li>Tidepool utilizes hardware-defined and/or software-defined boundaries to
segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of
service attacks.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Person or Entity Authentication</h4>
<ol>
<li>Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that
identifies him/her as the user of the information system.</li>
<li>Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password or
OpenID Connect that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
This is enforced through the use of <strong>Google Authentication</strong>.</li>
<li>All customer support interactions must be verified before Tidepool support
personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Unique User Identification</h4>
<ol>
<li>Access to the Tidepool Platform systems and applications is controlled by
requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and
developer.</li>
<li>Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).</li>
<li>Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in
plain text.</li>
<li>Default accounts on all production systems and environments, including root,
are disabled/locked.</li>
<li>Shared accounts are not allowed within Tidepool systems or networks.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Automatic Logon and Logoff</h4>
<ol>
<li>Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password
entry are not permitted for use with Tidepool workstations or production
systems.  </li>
<li>Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other
individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected
screen saver or logging off the system).</li>
<li>Information systems automatically lock users such as enabling
password-protected screensaver after 2 minutes or less of inactivity.</li>
<li>Information systems automatically enter standby or log users off the systems
after 30 minutes or less of inactivity.</li>
<li>The Security Officer must pre-approves any exception to automatic log off
requirements.</li>
</ol>
