<h3>Provisioning AWS Accounts</h3>
<h4>AWS Account Structure / Organization</h4>
<p>Tidepool maintains a single Organization in AWS, maintained in a
top-level AWS account (master). Sub-accounts are connected that each hosts
separate workloads and resources in its own sandboxed environment. The master
account itself handles aggregated billing for all connected sub-accounts but
does not host any workload, service or resource, with the exception of DNS
records for Tidepool root domain, using AWS Route53 service. DNS
records for subdomains are maintained in the corresponding sub-accounts.</p>
<p>Access to each account is funneled through our designated SSO provider, which
establishes a trust relationship to a set of predefined roles in the master
account. Once authenticated, a user then leverages AWS IAM Assume Role
capability to switch to a sub-account to access services and resources.</p>
<p>The account and network structure looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>SSO/IdP ── Tidepool-master
            │  └── billing and root DNS records only
            │
            ├── Tidepool-dev

            │                       └── Docker containers

<h4>Infrastructure-as-Code</h4>
<p>Tidepool AWS environments and infrastructure are managed as code.
Provisioning is accomplished using a set of automation scripts and Terraform
code.  Each new environment is created as a sub-account connected to
<code>Tidepool-master</code>.  The creation and provisioning of a new account
follows the instructions documented in the Bootstrap a new AWS environment page
of the development wiki.</p>
