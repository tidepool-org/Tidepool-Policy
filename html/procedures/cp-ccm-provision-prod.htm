<h3>Production Systems Provisioning</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before provisioning any systems, a request must be created and approved in
the https://tidepool.atlassian.net Security (SEC) project with an accompanying analysis in Confluence.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://tidepool.atlassian.net access requires authenticated users.</li>
<li>Security grants access to https://tidepool.atlassian.net following the procedures
covered in the <a href="access.htm">Access Establishment and Modification
section</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The security team must approve the provisioning request before any new system
can be provisioned, unless a pre-approved automation process is followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once provisioning has been approved, the implementer must configure the new
system according to the standard baseline chosen for the system's role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the system will be used to store sensitive information, the implementer
must ensure the volume containing this sensitive data is encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensitive data in motion must always be encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A security analysis is conducted once the system has been provisioned.  This
can be achieved either via automated configuration/vulnerability scans or
manual inspection by the security team. Verifications include, but is not
limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of default users used during provisioning.</li>
<li>Network configuration for system.</li>
<li>Data volume encryption settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new system is fully promoted into production upon successful verification
against corresponding Tidepool standards and change request approvals.</p>
