<h3>Risk Assessment and Analysis</h3>
<p>The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and
vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of
this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating
risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1. System Characterization</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To
do this, identify where sensitive data is received, maintained, processed, or
transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Tidepool Platform
boundaries are identified.</li>
<li>Output - Characterization of the Tidepool Platform system assessed, a good
picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform
boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2. Threat Identification</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully
exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All
potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and
data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a
list of potential threats.</li>
<li>Output - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could
exploit Platform vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3. Vulnerability Identification</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities
that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources.
Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that
govern an organization's computer usage to insufficient safeguards to
protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of
software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization's
computer network.</li>
<li>Output - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could
be exercised by potential threat-sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4. Control Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical
controls that have been or will be implemented by Tidepool to minimize or
eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a
Platform vulnerability.</li>
<li>Output - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures,
training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to
mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the
impact of such an adverse event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 5. Likelihood Determination</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability
that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the
existing or planned security controls.</li>
<li>Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to
the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 6. Impact Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat
successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems
to consider should include the importance to Tidepool's mission;
sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.</li>
<li>Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high
(100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 7. Risk Determination</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood
determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This
represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or
procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The
risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for
each risk level.</li>
<li>Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100).
Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 8. Control Recommendations</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as
appropriate to the organization's operations to an acceptable level.
Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of
recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and
regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and
reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation
process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security
controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.</li>
<li>Output - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to
mitigate risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 9. Results Documentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report,
spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make
decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and
management changes.</li>
<li>Output - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and
vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for
control implementation.</li>
</ul>
