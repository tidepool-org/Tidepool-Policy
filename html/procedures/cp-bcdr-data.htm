<h3>Production Environments and Data Recovery</h3>
<p>Production data is to be synchronized across S3 buckets in AWS.
Additionally, it is backed up to AWS Glacier for long term storage and recovery.
In an event that requires data to be recovered, it will be retrieved from
Glacier.</p>
<p>Tidepool assumes that in the worst-case scenario, that one of the
production environments suffers a complete data loss, the account will be
reconstructed from code, and the data restored from Glacier that is hosted
within a different AWS account and geolocation.</p>
<p>Recovery of production Environments and data should follow the procedures listed
above and in <a href="data-mgmt.md#cp-data-backup">Data Management - Backup and Recovery</a></p>
