<h3>Security Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation</h3>
<p>We follow a simple vulnerability tracking process using https://tidepool.atlassian.net. The
records of findings are retained for seven years.</p>
<h4>Reporting a finding</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon identification of a vulnerability (including vulnerability in software,
system, or process), a https://tidepool.atlassian.net Issue of (issueType =
<strong>Finding</strong>) is created on the SECURITY Project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Populate the following custom fields as part of the https://tidepool.atlassian.net issue when
applicable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Finding</strong> (dropdown list)</li>
<li><strong>In Production</strong> (yes/no/na selection)</li>
<li><strong>Application/Repo Name</strong> (text/tag)</li>
<li><strong>Version Number</strong> (text/tag)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Summary</strong> of the Finding should be in this format: "{[sev]} {short
description}" (e.g. "[High] Outdated package on ECS AMI image").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Description</strong> of the Finding should include further details, without
any confidential information, and a link to the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Priority</strong> of the Finding should match its severity level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Priority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements</h4>
<p>In an effort to quickly remediate security vulnerabilities the following timelines have been put in place to drive resolution.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Sev Rating</th>
<th align="center">Priority Level</th>
<th align="right">SLA</th>
<th align="left">Definition</th>
<th align="left">Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>P0</td>
<td align="center">Highest</td>
<td align="right">3 days</td>
<td align="left">Vulnerabilities that cause a privilege escalation on the platform from unprivileged to admin, allows remote code execution, financial theft, unauthorized access to/extraction of sensitive data, etc.</td>
<td align="left">Vulnerabilities that result in Remote Code Execution such as Vertical Authentication bypass, SSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, User authentication bypass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P1</td>
<td align="center">High</td>
<td align="right">7 days</td>
<td align="left">Vulnerabilities that affect the security of the platform including the processes it supports.</td>
<td align="left">Lateral authentication bypass, Stored XSS, some CSRF depending on impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P2</td>
<td align="center">Medium</td>
<td align="right">30 days</td>
<td align="left">Vulnerabilities that affect multiple users, and require little or no user interaction to trigger.</td>
<td align="left">Reflective XSS, Direct object reference, URL Redirect, some CSRF depending on impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P3</td>
<td align="center">Low</td>
<td align="right">Best Effort</td>
<td align="left">Issues that affect singular users and require interaction or significant prerequisites (MitM) to trigger.</td>
<td align="left">Common flaws, Debug information, Mixed Content.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the case a sev rating / priority level is updated after a vulnerability
finding was originally created, the SLA is updated as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>severity upgrade:</strong> reset SLA from time of escalation</li>
<li><strong>severity downgrade:</strong> SLA time remains the same from time of
creation/identification of finding</li>
</ul>
<h4>Resolving a finding</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Finding should be assigned to the owner responsible for the system or
software package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All findings should be addressed according to the established SLA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No software should be deployed to production with unresolved HIGH or MEDIUM
findings, unless an Exception is in place (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A finding may be resolved by</p>
<ol>
<li>providing a valid fix/mitigation</li>
<li>determining as a false positive</li>
<li>documenting an approved exception</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Closing a finding</h4>
<ul>
<li>The assignee should provide a valid resolution (see above) and add a comment
to the finding.</li>
<li>The finding should be re-assigned to the Reporter or a member of the security
team for validation.</li>
<li>Upon validation, the finding can be marked as Done (closed) by the Reporter.</li>
<li><strong>Before the finding can be marked as closed by the reporter, the fix must
be deployed to dev and have a targeted release date for deploying to
production noted on the ticket.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>An Exception may be requested when a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability
is not available. For example, a version of the package that contains the
fix is not supported on the particular operating system in use.</li>
<li>An alternative solution (a.k.a. compensating control) must be in place to
address the original vulnerability such that the risk is mitigated. The
compensating control may be technical or a process or a combination of both.</li>
<li>An Exception must be opened in the form of a https://tidepool.atlassian.net issue
(issueType = <strong>Exception</strong>) on the SECURITY project.</li>
<li>The Exception https://tidepool.atlassian.net issue must reference the original Finding
by adding an Issue Link to the Finding https://tidepool.atlassian.net issue.</li>
<li>Each Exception must be reviewed and approved by the Security team and the
impacted asset owner.</li>
<li>All Exceptions are reviewed every six months to re-assess its validity.</li>
</ul>
