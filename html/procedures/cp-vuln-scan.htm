<h3>Vulnerability Scanning and Infrastructure Security Testing</h3>
<p>The scanning and identification of system vulnerabilities is performed by</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Automated security agent installed on all Linux servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes physical and virtual servers hosted on premise as well as
EC2 instances in AWS.</li>
<li>The agent automatically reports to a centralized management
server/dashboard with details of the server instance and any vulnerability
finding.</li>
<li>This assessment is performed on an ongoing basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, periodic security scans of Tidepool on-premise systems are done
using a combination of open-source and commercial vulnerability testing
tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nmap</li>
<li>OWASP ZAP</li>
<li>Burp Suite Pro</li>
<li>Other security tools, as determined by Security Engineer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Tidepool
vulnerability management policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>External penetration testing is performed continuously through a public
vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program.</li>
<li>Additional external penetration testing is performed at least annually by
either a certified penetration tester on Tidepool security team or an
independent third party.</li>
<li>White-box internal penetration testing is performed on an ad-hoc basis by
the security team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tidepool developed an internal vulnerability management tool/database used to
track all system entities and associated vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Findings from a vulnerability scan or penetration testing are analyzed by the
security team, together with IT and Engineering as needed, and reported
following the process as defined in the next section. A written report may be
generated in addition to creating the findings in https://tidepool.atlassian.net.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All security testing reports and findings records are retained for 7 years.</p>
</li>
