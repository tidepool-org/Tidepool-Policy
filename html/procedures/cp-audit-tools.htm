<h3>Auditing and Assessment Tools</h3>
<p>Tidepool's Security Officer and the designated Security Engineer are authorized
to select and use assessment tools
that are designed to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions. Use of such tools
against Tidepool systems and environments are prohibited by others, including
Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorization of the Security
Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning tools and devices;</li>
<li>Password cracking utilities;</li>
<li>Network "sniffers";</li>
<li>Security agents installed locally on servers and endpoints;</li>
<li>Passive and active intrusion detection systems; and</li>
<li>Penetration testing tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what
is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether
publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the
system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls.</p>
