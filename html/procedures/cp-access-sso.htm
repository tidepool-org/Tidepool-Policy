<h3>Single Sign On</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tidepool selected Google SSO as its primary Identity Provider (IdP) to control
user access to systems and business applications.</li>
<li>Single sign-on (SSO) should be used whenever possible instead of local
authentication.  This centralized approach improves user experience and
simplifies access management.</li>
<li>SSO is configured via industry standard SAML protocol between the IdP (Google SSO)
and the target application.</li>
<li>Tidepool will not configure SSO to target applications unless they score a
"B" rating or higher on the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">Qualys SSL Labs</a>
benchmark.</li>
<li>Security team is responsible for the administration of the IdP / SSO system,
including user and access provisioning. Security team may delegate
administrative privilege to a subset of the system, such as a specific
application.</li>
