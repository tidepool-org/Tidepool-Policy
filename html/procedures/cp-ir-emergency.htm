<h3>Emergency Operations Mode</h3>
<p>If an incident constitutes an emergency – for example, a detected cyberattack
that impacts production systems – Tidepool plans to operate in a “read-only”
mode, to continue to provide customers access to their data. All write access is
temporarily blocked and data upload is paused until the emergency is resolved.
This is accomplished by updating the access policy in production AWS
environments.</p>
<p>In emergency operations mode, temporary access may be granted to security and/or
engineering team to access the production environments to perform forensics,
root cause analysis, eradication/remediation, or other necessary activities for
incident recovery.</p>
