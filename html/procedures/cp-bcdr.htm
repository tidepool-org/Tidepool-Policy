<h3>BCDR Objectives and Roles</h3>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>The following objectives have been established for this plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established
plan that consists of the following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Notification/Activation phase</em> to detect and assess damage and to
activate the plan;</li>
<li><em>Recovery phase</em> to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage
done to the original system;</li>
<li><em>Reconstitution phase</em> to restore IT system processing capabilities to
normal operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out
Tidepool processing requirements during prolonged interruptions
to normal operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Tidepool
systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for
recovering Tidepool during prolonged periods of interruption to
normal operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure coordination with other Tidepool staff who will
participate in the contingency planning strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will
participate in the contingency planning strategies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural
disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats,
and internal malicious activities.</p>
<p>Tidepool defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Critical Systems</em>. These systems host production application
servers/services and database servers/services or are required for
functioning of systems that host production applications and data. These
systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored,
or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming
unavailable.</li>
<li><em>Non-critical Systems</em>. These are all systems not considered critical by
definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and
overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from
functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a
lower priority than critical systems.</li>
</ol>

the Tidepool Contingency Plan is uninterrupted. The Chief Operating
