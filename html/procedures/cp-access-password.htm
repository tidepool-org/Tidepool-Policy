<h3>Password Management</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Tidepool systems and may
not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information
system using another user's unique user ID and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On all production systems and applications in the Tidepool environment,
password configurations are set to require:</p>
<ul>
<li>a minimum length of 12 characters;</li>
<li>a mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or
special characters;</li>
<li>90-day password expiration for administrative accounts;         </li>
<li>prevention of password reuse using a history of the last 24 passwords;</li>
<li>where supported, modifying at least 6 characters when changing passwords;</li>
<li>account lockout after 5 invalid attempts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>    Password expiration may be set to a greater interval if an account is always protected by MFA. 
    Currently, Google SSO password rotation interval is set to 1 year for non-admin services that 
    have MFA/2FA **enforced** via policy.

<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>All system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a
salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger NIST compliant standard).</li>
<li>Passwords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at
rest pursuant to the requirements in <a href="data-protection.htm">Data Protection</a>.</li>
<li>Transmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the
requirements in <a href="data-protection.htm">Data Protection</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a
pre-determined interval as determined by the system owner and/or Security,
based on the criticality and sensitivity of the data contained within the
network, system, application, and/or database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee's termination (refer
to the <a href="hr.htm">Employee Termination Procedures in HR policy</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All default system, application, and Vendor/Partner-provided passwords are
changed before deployment to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically
generated for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Password change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user
input errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to
immediately report the incident to the
<a href="mailto:security@tidepool.org">Security team</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where a user has forgotten their password, password reset
procedures provided by the IdP shall be followed. The exact process depends
on the system or application. If help is needed, users shall contact
<a href="mailto:security@tidepool.org">Security</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An approved password manager is used to store or share non-critical
business application passwords that are not integrated with our primary IdP
through SSO.</p>
<ul>
<li>The password manager locally encrypts the password vault with the user's
master password before synchronizing to the cloud.</li>
<li>The master password must follow the password requirements listed above.</li>
<li>MFA must enabled in the password manager configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
<li>An automated process/tool is implemented to ensure compromised passwords or
common dictionary words are not used as passwords.  This is currently
implemented in 1Password.</li>
