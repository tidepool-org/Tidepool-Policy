<h3>Secure Design and Application Threat Modeling</h3>
<p>Tidepool Security Team in collaboration with development team performs full
Application Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment on per-application basis using a
custom approach that relies on industry standards and best practices.</p>
<p>Major application updates are captured via an <strong>RFC</strong> process.  The RFC
template includes <strong>Security Consideration</strong> as a required section.  This
section is used to document abuse cases including: </p>
<ul>
<li>risks identified, </li>
<li>attack vectors, and </li>
<li>mitigating controls. </li>
</ul>
<p>Each RFC is required to capture sufficient details of the feature/component to
be developed, including use cases, motivation and outcome, and the following
design details as applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>authentication/authorization mechanisms, </li>
<li>network communications, </li>
<li>data encryption,</li>
<li>cloud services used,</li>
<li>logging/auditing, </li>
<li>data flow diagram/description,</li>
<li>edge cases, drawbacks, and alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RFC must be approved prior to implementation.  Security team is included in
RFC reviews via the pull request process.</p>
