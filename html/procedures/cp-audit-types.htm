<h3>Types of System Audits</h3>
<p>Tidepool's auditing processes include the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuration and Activity Monitoring:</strong> This refers to the logging,
monitoring, scanning and alerting of a system, account, or environment, which
may be achieved using real-time automated scripts/software or a manual
review/testing. This type of auditing is performed <em>continuously</em> as part of
Tidepool operations.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-info-tip">Examples include:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    * User: User and account-level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.
    * Application: Application-level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.
    * System: System-level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, file integrity, and other system-defined specific actions.
    * Network: Network-level scans or audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, perform penetrations, and identify vulnerabilities.
    * Traffic: Traffic refers to the incoming and outgoing traffic into and out of production/restricted environments. For example, firewall logs or VPC flow logs in AWS.
    * Data: Data includes all successful and failed attempts at production data access and editing.

    *Data associated with above events will include origin, destination, action performed, timestamp, and other relevant details available.*

<li>
<p><strong>Access Review:</strong> This refers to the review of all user and service accounts
and permissions across Tidepool operational environments, including
on-premise systems, cloud environments such as AWS accounts, and other
applications such as collaboration software, ticketing system and code repos.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tidepool leverages automated cloud tools to automatically pull configurations
from our cloud based environments, including</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS access configuration from IAM policies, EC2 VPC and security group
settings, S3 bucket policies, Lambda and API Gateway resources, etc.;</li>
<li>Users, groups, application access from Google directory;</li>
<li>Network access settings from AWS and Google, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data is collected either on demand, triggered by security team, or by
changes in the operational environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data is used by the tool to aggregate and analyze user and application
access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to other systems and applications that are not covered by this
automated tool are reviewed manually on a quarterly
basis or with any significant change to the target environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of each review, unused or invalid access will be removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance and Controls Audit:</strong> This refers to the audit performed against
the Technical, Administrative, and/or Physical controls as defined in
Tidepool policies and procedures, to measure their adoption and
effectiveness.  This type of auditing is typically performed by either a
designated internal audit team or an external audit firm, at <em>defined
intervals</em> or prompted by a <em>trigger event</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-info-tip">Potential trigger events include:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    * Scheduled compliance audit/assessment (e.g. annual risk assessment)
    * High risk or problem prone incidents or events, or as part of post-incident activities
    * Business associate, customer, or partner complaints
    * Identification of significant security vulnerabilities
    * Atypical patterns of activity
    * Failed authentication attempts
    * Remote access use and activity
    * Activity post termination
    * Random audits
