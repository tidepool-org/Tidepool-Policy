<h3>Review and Reporting of Audit Findings</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Audit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely
manner, at least monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s).
Additional reviews are performed as needed to assure the proper data is being
captured and retained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit
findings to relevant workforce members, Customers, or Partners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format.
Tidepool's security incident response form may be utilized to report a
single event.</li>
<li>Routine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure
in a written report format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum
necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally
without administrative and/or legal counsel approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that
may be included in Tidepool's performance improvement activities and
reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are
disclosed to administrative-level oversight structures only and that
information which may further expose organizational risk is shared with
extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in
organizational reports (individually-identifiable information shall not be
included in the reports).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective
actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with
the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners.</p>
