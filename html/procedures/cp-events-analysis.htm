<h3>Security Events Analysis</h3>
<p>Security logs, events, and audit trails are reviewed by the security team with
the assistance of automated systems and processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Auditing logs are automatically analyzed and correlated by the monitoring
solutions and Tidepool's centralized security information and event management
system, Sumo Logic.</li>
<li>The systems are configured with rules/policies to identify suspicious
activities, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  </li>
<li>Alerts are triggered upon identification of an issue based on the policy
configuration.  </li>
<li>The alerts are sent immediately to the responsible staff (e.g. security team)
for analysis. The alerts may be sent via email, Slack messaging under most circumstances.</li>
<li>Analysis is prioritized based on alert severity.  High severity alerts are
typically reviewed within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Incident response process is followed, as needed.</li>
<li>Patches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner.</li>
