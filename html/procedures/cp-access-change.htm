<h3>Access Establishment, Modification and Termination</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Requests for access to Tidepool Platform systems and applications is made
formally using the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An access request is created in https://tidepool.atlassian.net through either the new employee
onboarding request or a specific access request from Tidepool Internal
Support site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Security team will grant standard access to per job role as part of
new employee onboarding. A standard set of accounts that are default for
all employees are created as part of the onboarding process. This
includes</p>
<ul>
<li>User account for local system/laptop</li>
<li>Okta user in the Everyone group, and additional group based on role
such as Development, IT, Security</li>
<li>Office365 account for access to Outlook email, SharePoint, etc.</li>
<li>Ataata account for security awareness training</li>
<li>HR accounts for paperwork, benefits management, payroll, expense
reporting, etc.</li>
<li>https://tidepool.atlassian.net access for submitting support requests</li>
<li>Additional role based access (e.g. https://github.com/tidepool-org and circle-ci.org access for a
developer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard access may be provisioned at any time by account
owners/administrators at any time during or after onboarding with
approval of account owners and/or manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If additional access is needed in addition to the above, a separate
access request (through https://tidepool.atlassian.net) is required and the requester must include
a description and justification as part of the access request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the review is completed, the Security team approves or rejects the
Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and
documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the review is approved, IT or Security team provisions access, then
marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</p>
<ul>
<li>New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that
meets all password requirements, which must be changed on the initial
login.</li>
<li>All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.</li>
<li>For on-premise systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the
appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP/AD group.</li>
<li>For cloud accounts, access grants are provisioned in Okta or using the
access control mechanisms built into those services/applications.</li>
<li>Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a
Tidepool employee at the discretion of the Security Officer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special access, including access to production environments, is not granted
until receipt, review, and approval by the Tidepool Security Officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The request for access is retained for future reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business
purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not
left unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content,
identification and authentication may not be required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
