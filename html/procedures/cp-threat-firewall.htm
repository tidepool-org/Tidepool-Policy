<h3>Firewall Protection</h3>
<p>Firewall protection is implemented at the following layers</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - including Network ACL and Security Groups in AWS </li>
<li><strong>Host</strong> - local firewalls are enabled on the user endpoints as well as
servers (compute and database instances in AWS are protected by security
groups)</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong> - content distribution is
configured at the application layer to protect against common web application
attacks such as cross site scripting, injection and denial-of-service attacks.</li>
</ul>
