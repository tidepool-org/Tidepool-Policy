<h3>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</h3>
<p>Dynamic testing is available by request to the Security team and is performed
using TBD. Security team is currently looking into automation of
this type of scanning.</p>
<p>Additionally, manual baseline dynamic testing is available by request to the
Security team.</p>
<h4>Integration of Dynamic testing into automatic tests</h4>
<p>Upon availability of automatic UI tests for applications being developed
internally, an extension based on <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP
ZAP</a> is used to
transparently work with any UI tests available and automatically
add basic dynamic tests into build pipeline.</p>
