<h3>Vendor Technology Risk Review</h3>
<p>Tidepool security policy requires a risk review of vendor
technology, prior to any technology being integrated to Tidepool
operations and/or infrastructure. Employees are required to engage security team
to conduct such review. The request may be submitted by email directly to the
security team, or by opening a https://tidepool.atlassian.net ticket through the
Tidepool internal service desk.</p>
<p>Security team is responsible to conduct the reviews via interviews and reviews
of documentation, to ensure the vendor complies with regulatory requirements and
follows security best practices to minimize risk to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>A vendor technology risk (VTR) assessment is conducted using Confluence, in
the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reviewer sends questionnaire link(s) to vendor contact.</li>
<li>Vendor completes the questionnaire(s).</li>
<li>Vendor saves/exports answers to the assessment questionnaire(s).</li>
<li>Vendor contact sends the answers file back to reviewer.</li>
<li>Reviewer opens the same questionnaire(s) and loads the answers received from
the vendor to complete the assessment.</li>
<li>Reviewer follows up with vendor contact as needed.</li>
<li>Reviewer facilities discussion with business owner to determine if the risk
is acceptable. Vendor remediation may be required depending on the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>A list of <a href="approved-vendors.htm">approved vendors / contractors</a> is maintained by the Security and
Operations teams.</p>
