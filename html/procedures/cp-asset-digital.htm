<h3>Digital Asset Inventory</h3>
<p>Tidepool Security team uses an automated system to query across our cloud-based
infrastructure, including but is not limited to AWS, to obtain detailed records
of all digital assets, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>

<li>AWS S3 repositories</li>
<li>AWS Lambda functions</li>
<li>Security agents</li>
<li>Source code repositories</li>
<li>User accounts</li>

<p>The records are stored in a database system maintained by Tidepool security
team. Records are tagged with owner/project and classification when applicable.
All records are kept up to date via automation.</p>
