<h3>Service Accounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>All application to application communication using service accounts is
restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are
used to limit account access across applications and systems.</li>
<li>Services that are part of Tidepool platform leverage AWS IAM policy
configurations and/or OAuth for authorization.</li>
<li>Generic accounts are not allowed on Tidepool systems.</li>
<li>Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application
authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict
access.</li>
<li>In AWS, service accounts are implemented in the form of IAM Roles, and their
access defined by the corresponding IAM policies. The creation of these IAM
roles and policies is implemented as code, which follows the secure
development, review and production change approval process.</li>
<li>An inventory of all Service accounts is maintained by AWS IAM and
reviewed periodically.</li>
