<h3>Certificate Management</h3>
<p>Tidepool uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and LetsEncrypt for
certificate management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificates are renewed automatically.</li>
<li>Security and Operations teams monitors the certificates for expiration, potential compromise
and use/validity. Certificate revocation process is invoked if the certificate
is no longer needed or upon discovery of potential compromise.</li>
</ul>
