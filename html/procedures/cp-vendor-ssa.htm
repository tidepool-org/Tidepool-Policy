<h3>Software and Systems Acquisition Process</h3>
<p>Tidepool Security maintains
a list of <a href="approved-software.htm">pre-approved business software</a> and
a list of <a href="approved-vendors.htm">approved vendors / contractors</a>.</p>
<p>If additional commercial software, hardware system, or cloud services is needed,
a request should be submitted through Tidepool internal service
desk. This will trigger the approval by manager/security and procurement
process.</p>
<p>As applicable, Tidepool security team may conduct a risk analysis on
the software or system to ensure it complies with Tidepool security,
compliance and legal requirements and does not interfere with the security
controls. If a risk is identified, additional controls should be identified and
implemented (or planned) prior to acquisition. An alternative product may be
considered as a result of the risk analysis.</p>
