<h3>High Level Application Security Requirements</h3>
<p>All Tidepool software must be developed to include the following general
application security principles and requirements.  Web applications must also
protect itself against the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2017_Release_Candidate">OWASP Top
10</a>
vulnerabilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect sensitive customer data such as PHI,
PII and account passwords. Encrypt data stored (at rest).</li>
<li>Secure data in transit and customer communications via TLS.</li>
<li>Provision strong access control (authentication and authorization). Prevent
and report unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Log all transactions and activities to be able to tell who did what, when,
where, and how. Mask or remove sensitive data in logs.</li>
<li>Implement client security at application endpoints (e.g. browser, mobile
app).</li>
<li>Communicate securely across application endpoints and between service
consumers/producers.</li>
<li>Use secure defaults to ensure security when in all error conditions.</li>
<li>Check and maintain the security of all third party and open source
libraries/components/dependencies.</li>
<li>Validate all data inputs; encode data outputs when appropriate.</li>
<li>Deploy and configure applications securely to production.</li>
<li>Perform regular vulnerability analysis and apply security patches promptly.</li>
<li>Secure privileged access to production environments and ensure ongoing
application monitoring.</li>
</ol>
<p>All software code should complete an appropriate set of security scans/testing prior to being
deployed to production, including open source dependency scanning, static and
dynamic application security testing, as well as periodic penetration testing.</p>
<p>Pre-production testing is performed with nonproduction data in nonproduction
environments. Health checks are performed regularly or automated in production.</p>
<p>Software vulnerability identified through any of the above processes shall be
reported and tracked following Tidepool Vulnerability Management process
as defined in the <a href="vuln-mgmt.htm">Vulnerability Management Policy and Procedures</a>.</p>
