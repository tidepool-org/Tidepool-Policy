<h3>Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports</h3>
<p>Tidepool, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including
any Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) and exceptions, with customers on a case by case
basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in Tidepool format
between Tidepool and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested
by Tidepool workforce members for Customers or directly by Tidepool Customers.</p>
<p>The following process is used to request audit reports:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request may be sent by email to
<a href="mailto:compliance@tidepool.org">compliance@tidepool.org</a>
or by submitting a request via Tidepool Internal Support Portal
or Email. In the request, please specify the type of report being requested
and any required timelines for the report.</li>
<li>An Issue with the details of the request into the Tidepool Security Project
on https://tidepool.atlassian.net, which is used to track requests status and outcomes.</li>
<li>Tidepool security team will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the
party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Tidepool will
send one for execution.</li>
<li>Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Tidepool staff will move
the https://tidepool.atlassian.net Issue to "Under Review".</li>
<li>The Tidepool Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the
Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Tidepool will notify the requesting party
that we cannot share the requested report.</li>
<li>If the Issue has been Approved, Tidepool will send the customer the requested
audit report and complete the https://tidepool.atlassian.net Issue for the request.</li>
</ol>

<h4>External Audits of Information Access and Activity</h4>
<p>Prior to contracting with an external audit firm, Tidepool shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the audit responsibility, authority, and accountability</li>
<li>Choose an audit firm that is independent of other organizational operations</li>
<li>Ensure technical competence of the audit firm staff</li>
<li>Require the audit firm's adherence to applicable codes of professional ethics</li>
<li>Assign organizational responsibility for supervision of the external audit
firm</li>
<li>Obtain a signed HIPAA business associate agreement, if any ePHI will be shared/accessed during the audit</li>
<li>Obtain a signed GDPR data processing agreement, if any personal data will be shared/accessed during the audit</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever possible, a third party auditing vendor should not be providing the
organization IT oversight services (e.g., vendors providing IT services should
not be auditing their own services to ensure separation of duties).</p>
