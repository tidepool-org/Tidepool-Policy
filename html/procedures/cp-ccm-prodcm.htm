<p>In order to promote changes into Production, a valid and approved Change Request
(CR) is required. It can be created in the <a href="https://tidepool.atlassian.net">Change Management System/Portal</a>
which implements the Tidepool Change Management workflow, using the
(BACK) https://tidepool.atlassian.net project to manage
changes and approvals.</p>
