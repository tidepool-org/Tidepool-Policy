### User Endpoint Security Controls and Configuration

1. Employee laptops, including Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, are configured
   either

    * Manually by IT or the device owner; or
    * Automatically using a configuration management tool or equivalent scripts.

2. The following security controls are applied at the minimum:

    * Disk encryption
    * Unique user accounts and strong passwords
    * Approved NTP servers
    * Approved security agents
    * Locking after 2 mins of inactivity
    * Auto-update of security patches

3. The security configurations on all end-user systems are inspected by Security
   through either a manual periodic review or an automated compliance auditing
   tool.
