## Review and Reporting

The information security program, policies, procedures and controls are reviewed
on a regular basis internally by cross functional team members.

A security scorecard is produced every month with updates
to key metrics of the Tidepool information security program, to
measure its adoption and effectiveness.

The latest scorecard can be accessed here, once populated : [Security
Scorecard](N/A).
