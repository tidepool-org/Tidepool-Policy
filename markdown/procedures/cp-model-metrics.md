### Metrics, Measurements and Continuous Monitoring

A set of metrics / KPIs have been defined to assist in the measuring, reporting
and optimizing the security program and the controls in place.

A security scorecard is produced every day with updates
to key metrics of the Tidepool information security program, to
measure its adoption and effectiveness.

The Security reports and scorecards are maintained by and can be accessed at JupiterOne, k8s and AWS monitoring.
