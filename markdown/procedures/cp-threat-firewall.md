### Firewall Protection

Firewall protection is implemented at the following layers

* **Network** - including Network ACL and Security Groups in AWS 

* **Host** - local firewalls are enabled on the user endpoints as well as
  servers (compute and database instances in AWS are protected by security
  groups)

* **Application** - content distribution is
  configured at the application layer to protect against common web application
  attacks such as cross site scripting, injection and denial-of-service attacks.
