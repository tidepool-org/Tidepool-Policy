### Configuration and Management of Network Controls

All network devices and controls on a sensitive network are configured such
that:

* Vendor provided default configurations are modified securely, including

  - default encryption keys,
  - default SNMP community strings, if applicable,
  - default passwords/passphrases, and
  - other security-related vendor defaults, if applicable.

* Encryption keys and passwords are changed anytime anyone with knowledge of the
  keys or passwords leaves the company or changes positions.

* Traffic filtering (e.g. firewall rules) and inspection (e.g. Network IDS/IPS
  or AWS VPC flow logs) are enabled.

* An up-to-date network diagram is maintained.

In AWS, network controls are implemented using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and
Security Groups. The configurations are managed as code and stored in approved
repos. All changes to the configuration follow the defined code review, change
management and production deployment approval process.
