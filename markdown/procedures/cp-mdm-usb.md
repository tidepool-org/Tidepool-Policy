### Use of USB Flash Drive and External Storage Device

Per Tidepool corporate policy, confidential and critical data may
not be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives.
This includes and is not limited to ePHI.
For definition of confidential and critical data, see
Tidepool Data Classification and Handling Policy.

Usage of USB flash drives for temporary transfer of confidential and critical
data may be allowed on a case by case basis, when the following process is
followed:

*   Data is only allowed on encrypted flash devices approved by Tidepool
    Security and the IT Manager (currently **security approval**).
*   The process starts with the submission of a ticket in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidepool.atlassian.net.
    The ticket must be approved by IT and Security.
*   Upon completion of data transfer all sensitive data on the device must be
    completely removed.
*   The device is to be returned to the IT Manager to double check that the data
    has been removed.
*   The IT Manager will check the drive back in.
