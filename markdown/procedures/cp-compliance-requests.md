### Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports

Tidepool, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including
any Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) and exceptions, with customers on a case by case
basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in Tidepool format
between Tidepool and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested
by Tidepool workforce members for Customers or directly by Tidepool Customers.

The following process is used to request audit reports:

1. A request may be sent by email to
   [compliance@tidepool.org](mailto:compliance@tidepool.org)
   or by submitting a request via Tidepool Internal Support Portal
   or Email. In the request, please specify the type of report being requested
   and any required timelines for the report.
2. An Issue with the details of the request into the Tidepool Security Project
   on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidepool.atlassian.net, which is used to track requests status and outcomes.
3. Tidepool security team will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the
   party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Tidepool will
   send one for execution.
4. Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Tidepool staff will move
   the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidepool.atlassian.net Issue to "Under Review".
5. The Tidepool Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the
   Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Tidepool will notify the requesting party
   that we cannot share the requested report.
4. If the Issue has been Approved, Tidepool will send the customer the requested
   audit report and complete the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidepool.atlassian.net Issue for the request.
