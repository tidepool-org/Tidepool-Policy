### Employee Onboarding Procedures

A master checklist for employee onboarding and offboarding is maintained by VP of People.  
It is published in [Tidepool's People Space in Confluence](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/l/cp/5Xvf6VZL).

The VP of People or their designate is responsible to create and maintain a new checklist
to document the processes, which should include the following IT/Security items:

1. Training.

    * New workforce member is provided training on Tidepool security policy,
      acceptable use policy, and given access to the Employee
      Handbook and internal documentation.
    * HIPAA awareness training is provided to new workforce member.
    * Records of training and policy acceptance are kept in Google Drive
    * The training and acceptance must be completed within 10 days of
      employment.

2. Access.

    * Standard access is provisioned according to the job role and approval as
      specified in the Onboarding checklist and as agreed by their management.
    * Non-standard access requires additional approval following the access
      request procedures.
    * Request for modifications of access for any Tidepool employee
      can be made using the procedures outlined in the
      [Access Establishment and Modification policy and procedures](access.md).

3. System configuration.

    * The end-user computing device (e.g. workstation or laptop) may be
      provisioned by IT to install necessary software, malware protection,
      security agents, and setting system configurations.
    * Users in a technical role, such as Development, may choose to self
      configure their system. In this case, the user is given configuration
      guidelines defined by IT and Security. The system must have the required
      security configuration and endpoint agents installed for monitoring and to
      ensure compliance.
