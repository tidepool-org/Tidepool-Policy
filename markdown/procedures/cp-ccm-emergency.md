### Emergency Change

In the event of an emergency, the person or team on call is notified.  This may
include a combination or Development, IT, and Security.

If an emergency change must be made, such as patching of a zero-day security
vulnerability or recovering from a system downtime, and that the standard change
management process cannot be followed due to time constraint or personnel
availability or other unforeseen issues, the change can be made by:

* **Notification:** The Engineering Lead, Security Lead, and/or IT Lead must be
  notified by email, Slack, or phone call prior to the change . Depending on the
  nature of the emergency, the leads may choose to inform members of the
  executive team.

* **Post-emergency Documentation:** A PROD ticket should be created prior to the emergency change, if possible. The ticket should contains all details
  related to the change, including:

    * Reason for emergency change
    * Steps and details of the change that was made
    * Sign-off/approvals must be obtained per the type of change as defined by
      the standard CM process

* **Prevention and Improvement:** 
    * Any process improvement and/or preventative measures should be documented and an implementation plan should be developed
    * All emergency changes will be associated with an Incident ticket, and complete a CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions) review
