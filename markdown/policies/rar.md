# Roles, Responsibilities and Training

`2022.08.26`

Security and compliance is everyone's responsibility.  Tidepool is committed to
ensuring all workforce members actively address security and compliance in their
roles. Statistically, cybersecurity breaches typically start with compromise of
end-user computing devices, social engineering, human error or insider threat.
Therefore, users are the first line of defense and yet usually the weakest link.
As such, training is imperative to assuring an understanding of current best
practices, the different types and sensitivities of data, and the sanctions
associated with non-compliance.

In this and all related policy documents, the term "employees" and "workforce
members" may be used interchangeably to include all full-time and part-time
employees in all job roles, contractors and subcontractors, volunteers, interns,
managers and executives at Tidepool.

The Security Officer, in collaboration with the Privacy Officer, is responsible

The intent of the Security Officer Responsibilities is to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of critical and sensitive data. The Security
and Privacy Officer is appointed by and reports to the Board of Directors and/or
the CEO.
