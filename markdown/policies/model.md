# Security Architecture and Operating Model

`2022.08.26`

In the digital age, cyber attacks are inevitable. At Tidepool, we are taking a
“zero trust”, “minimal infrastructure” approach to managing risk and information
security.

This document describes our guiding principles and aspirations in managing risk
and the building blocks of our security model.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) Tidepool's security program and operations should be designed and implemented:

1. to minimize the potential for patient risk
2. with the following objectives and best practices:

* data-centric, cloud-first architecture
* assume compromise therefore never trust, always verify
* apply controls using least-privilege and defense-in-depth principles
* avoid single point of compromise
* automate whenever possible, the simpler the better, less is more
* prompt self management and reward good behaviors

(b) Security shall remain a top priority in all aspects of Tidepool's business
operations and product development.
