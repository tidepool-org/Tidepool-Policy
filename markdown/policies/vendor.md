# Third Party Security, Vendor Risk Management and Systems/Services Acquisition

`2019.07.31`

Tidepool makes every effort to assure all third party organizations are
compliant and do not compromise the integrity, security, and privacy of Tidepool
or Tidepool Customer data. Third Parties include Vendors, Customers, Partners,
Subcontractors, and Contracted Developers.

## Policy Statements

Tidepool policy requires that:

(a) A list of approved vendors/partners must be maintained and reviewed
annually at minimum.

(b) Approval from management, procurement and security must be in place prior to
onboarding any new vendor or contractor. Additionally, all changes to existing
contract agreements must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation.
This review is critical to Tidepool systems or applications that process PHI.

(c) For any technology solution that needs to be integrated with Tidepool
production environment or operations, a Vendor Technology Review must be
performed by the security team to understand and approve the risk. Periodic
compliance assessment and SLA review may be required.

(d) Tidepool Customers or Partners should not be allowed access outside of their
own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete any data
belonging to other 3rd parties.

(e) Additional vendor agreements are obtained as required by applicable
regulatory compliance requirements.


* A standard HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is defined and includes
the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security
policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements. A BAA
must be signed with any vendor that may have a business need to access, and/or
unsupervised access to PHI or ePHI.


* A GDPR Data Processing Agreement/Addendum (DPA) is defined and executed for
each Tidepool vendor/contractor that processes personal data of
EU users.
