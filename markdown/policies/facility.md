# Facility Access and Physical Security

`2022.01.21`

Tidepool as a company is a fully distributed, remote and cloud-native architecture.
As such, we do not have a physical premise or facilityother than cloud resources and individual compute assets such as laptops.
Tidepool exists fully in "the cloud".

Tidepool works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to
systems used as part of the Tidepool Platform. These assets exist in fully secured and certified data centers with SOC-2 and above level controls for facility access and physical  security. Tidepool inherits physical and facility access controls from these providers for all contracted services.


Tidepool Subcontractors control access to the physical
buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which
Tidepool workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA
Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. In an effort to
safeguard ePHI from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed
to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for
unauthorized persons.
