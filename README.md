# Tidepool-Policy

This is a WIP effort to standardize process for editing and updating Tidepool IT Policies content to faciliate documenting compliance for audit purposes and to pre-assess and start preparing for a HiTech/HiTrust certification in the coming year.

Tidepool has existing policies that will be merged/integrated with these documents.
