# Tidepool-Policy

This is a WIP effort to standardize process for editing and updating Tidepool IT Policies content to faciliate compliance for audit purposes and to pre-assess and start preparing for a SOC 2 Audit certification.

Tidepool has existing policies that will be merged/integrated with these documents.

[Tidepool Public Security Documentation](https://tidepool.org/security) A good starting place for current policy, compliance and infrastructure documentation
